# Background

Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), induces reverse remodeling,
improves symptoms, and reduces mortality in carefully selected heart failure (HF)
patients with left ventricular (LV) dyssynchrony [@ojo_cardiac_2017]. However, a nonresponse rate of 30-40% is still
observed [@zhang_incidence_2015], indicating a need for further refinement of
current criteria for selecting patients to undergo CRT. Left ventricular 
dyssynchrony is a discoordination of intraventricular regional
mechanical LV activation. Mechanical dyssynchrony has been proposed as one of
the principal therapeutic targets of CRT [@leclercq_retimingfailingheart_2002]. As such,
mechanical dyssynchrony makes for a potential predictor of CRT response.

Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) feature tracking has been used to 
characterize mechanical contraction features in patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB)
compared to healthy controls [@revah_cardiovascularmagneticresonance_2016]. The COMPANION,
REVERSE, and MADIT-CRT trials demonstrated that patients with LBBB derived greater
benefit from CRT compared to those with other conduction patterns [@zareba_effectiveness_2011;
@gold_effect_2012; @bristow_cardiac-resynchronization_2004]. Furthermore,
positive CRT response and "super-response" to CRT have to an even greater extent
been found to be associated with strict LBBB, as defined by Strauss et al.
[@strauss_definingleftbundle_2011], when compared to LBBB defined by conventional criteria
[@mascioli_electrocardiographiccriteriatrue_2012; @tian_truecompleteleft_2013].
This is likely a result of greater specificity for the strict LBBB criteria for
identifying significant LV dyssynchrony, the substrate that is corrected by CRT.

Abnormalities of regional myocardial mechanics can be caused by conduction
abnormalities, especially LBBB, or by focal
myocardial fibrosis, also referred to as scar [@maret_functional_2009].
Myocardial scarring has been found to be negatively associated with CRT response
[@delgado_relative_2011; @bilchick_impactmechanicalactivation_2014;
@taylor_leftventricularlead_2016; @atwater_ecg_2015]. Indices of mechanical
dyssynchrony are often derived from measurements of cardiac deformation such as
strain. Strain measurements have been found to be greatly affected by the
presence of myocardial scar [@goto_comparison_2017; @luetkens_feature-tracking_2017;
@khan_comparison_2015] or myocardial edema [@luetkens_feature-tracking_2017;
@khan_comparison_2015]. Importantly, the failure of most indices of mechanical dyssynchrony
can be attributed to a lack of specificity [@voigt_cardiac_2016]. Consequently,
the goal of dyssynchrony analysis should be detection of a mechanical
dyssynchrony pattern amenable to CRT, and not the detection of mechanical
dyssynchrony per se [@voigt_cardiac_2016]. Information about mechanical
dyssynchrony characteristics in patients with a high likelihood of CRT
response, while at the same time controlling for concomitant pathology, e.g
myocardial scar, is of great interest in identifying predictors of CRT
response. However, information about this is scarce.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate mechanical dyssynchrony characteristics of
patients with strict LBBB and normal QRS duration, a left ventricular ejection
fraction ${\le}35\%$ and no LV myocardial scar assessed by
CMR late gadolinium enhancement (LGE).
