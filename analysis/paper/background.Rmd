# Introduction

Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) has shown major favorable effects for
the treatment of patients with heart failure (HF), severe LV dysfunction, and
prolonged QRS duration. The COMPANION, REVERSE, and MADIT-CRT trials
demonstrated that patients with LBBB derived greater benefit from CRT compared
to those with other conduction patterns
[@zareba_effectiveness_2011; @gold_effect_2012;
@bristow_cardiac-resynchronization_2004].
Furthermore, strict LBBB, as defined by Strauss, et al., has to an even greater extent been found
associated with positive CRT response and also identifies patients with
a "super-response" to CRT [@strauss_definingleftbundle_2011], when compared to
LBBB defined by conventional criteria
[@mascioli_electrocardiographiccriteriatrue_2012; @tian_truecompleteleft_2013].
This is likely a result of greater specificity for the strict LBBB criteria for
identifying clinically significant LV dyssynchrony.

Non-specific intraventricular conduction delay (IVCD) is the second most
prevalent conduction abnormality amongst patients receiving CRT
[@vereckei_roleelectrocardiographyelaboration_2016;
@friedman_cardiacresynchronizationtherapy_2023]. IVCD is often grouped together
with right bundle branch block (RBBB), atypical LBBB, and atypical RBBB as
"non-LBBB". In non-LBBB, no overall benefit of CRT has previously been shown
[@rickard_predictorsresponsecardiac_2016; @sipahi_effectqrsmorphology_2012].
Consequently, this grouping has recently been contested in a large patient-level
meta-analysis including several pivotal CRT trials
[@friedman_cardiacresynchronizationtherapy_2023]. In that study, patients with
wide QRS (>150ms) and either LBBB or IVCD had similar effect of CRT in
reducing heart failure hospitalization or death
[@friedman_cardiacresynchronizationtherapy_2023].

Considering the heterogeneity in the "non-LBBB" group of patients, predicting
CRT response based on QRS duration and ECG morphology in isolation could be too
simplistic an approach [@peichl_spectruminterintraventricular_2004]. CMR
measures of dyssynchrony may be useful in identifying those patients without
LBBB or normal conduction who have mechanical dyssynchrony that may benefit from
CRT. CMR studies of regional mechanics might help identify subgroups
of patients with LBBB-like characteristics. An index sensitive to the specific
mechanical characteristics of strict LBBB and its associated high CRT response
rate would potentially facilitate an assessment of dyssynchrony in patients
without strict LBBB. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to identify
such an index by comparing the discriminatory ability of two currently used
methods of CMR dyssynchrony measurement to distinguish patients with strict LBBB
from patients with normal conduction. We also sought to control for
other myocardial abnormalities that can impact the electro-mechanical
association by only including subjects with left ventricular ejection fraction
(LVEF) ${\le}35\%$, and no LV myocardial scar assessed by CMR late gadolinium
enhancement (LGE).
