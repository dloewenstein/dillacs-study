# Background

Information about mechanical dyssynchrony characteristics in patients with a
high likelihood of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) response is of great
interest in identifying predictors of CRT response. Left ventricular (LV)
dyssynchrony, the substrate that is corrected by CRT, is a discoordination of
intraventricular regional mechanical LV activation. However, LV dyssynchrony is
not a unique feature of a single etiology. Rather, abnormalities of regional
myocardial mechanics can be caused by conduction abnormalities, especially LBBB,
or by focal myocardial fibrosis, also referred to as scar
[@maret_functional_2009].

Myocardial scarring has been found to be negatively
associated with CRT response [@delgado_relative_2011;
@bilchick_impactmechanicalactivation_2014; @taylor_leftventricularlead_2016;
@atwater_ecg_2015]. Indices of mechanical dyssynchrony are often derived from
measurements of cardiac deformation such as strain. Strain measurements have
been found to be greatly affected by the presence of myocardial scar
[@goto_comparison_2017; @luetkens_feature-tracking_2017; @khan_comparison_2015]
or myocardial edema [@luetkens_feature-tracking_2017; @khan_comparison_2015].
Hence, the failure of most indices of mechanical dyssynchrony can be attributed
to a lack of specificity [@voigt_cardiac_2016]. Consequently, the goal of
dyssynchrony analysis should be detection of a mechanical dyssynchrony pattern
amenable to CRT, and not the detection of mechanical dyssynchrony per se
[@voigt_cardiac_2016].

The COMPANION, REVERSE, and MADIT-CRT trials demonstrated that patients with
LBBB derived greater benefit from CRT compared to those with other conduction
patterns [@zareba_effectiveness_2011; @gold_effect_2012;
@bristow_cardiac-resynchronization_2004]. Furthermore, positive CRT response and
"super-response" to CRT have to an even greater extent been found to be
associated with strict LBBB, as defined by Strauss et al.
[@strauss_definingleftbundle_2011], when compared to LBBB defined by
conventional criteria [@mascioli_electrocardiographiccriteriatrue_2012;
@tian_truecompleteleft_2013]. This is likely a result of greater specificity for
the strict LBBB criteria for identifying clinically significant LV dyssynchrony.
Non-specific intraventricular conduction delay (IVCD) is the second most
prevalent conduction abnormality amongst patients receiving CRT
[@vereckei_roleelectrocardiographyelaboration_2016; @friedman_cardiacresynchronizationtherapy_2023].
No overall benefit of CRT has previously been shown for patients with heart
failure (HF) and IVCD [@rickard_predictorsresponsecardiac_2016;
@sipahi_effectqrsmorphology_2012]. Consequently, this has recently been contested in
a large patient-level meta-analysis including several pivotal CRT trials
[@friedman_cardiacresynchronizationtherapy_2023].

The definition of IVCD makes for a heterogenous group
[@eschalier_nonspecificintraventricularconduction_2015], and predicting CRT
response based on QRS duration and electrocardiogram (ECG) morphology in
isolation could be too simplistic an approach
[@peichl_spectruminterintraventricular_2004]. Patients with LBBB and IVCD,
respectively, differ in their electrocardiographic phenotypes. However,
similarities in regional myocardial mechanics might help identify subgroups of
IVCD patients with LBBB-like characteristics. An index summarizing the specific
mechanical characteristics of LBBB would effectively facilitate such a
comparison. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare and validate the
specificity of two previously developed indices of dyssynchrony in their ability
to identify the mechanical characteristics induced by strict LBBB, compared to
normal QRS duration, in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)
${\le}35\%$, and no LV myocardial scar assessed by CMR lage gadolinium
enhancement (LGE).
