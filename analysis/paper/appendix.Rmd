(ref:dysboxplot-text) Values for the circumferential uniformity ratio estimate (CURE) and the systolic stretch index (SSI) for left bundle branch block (LBBB) and controls. The box and whisker plots show the median (horizontal line),  interquartile range (box), and data points within $1.5 \times$ interquartiles ranges of the first and third quartile, respectively (whiskers). Note, there is more pronounced mechanical dyssynchrony (lower CURE, higher SSI) in LBBB compared to control. CURE is more homogenously distributed between groups compared to SSI.

```

(ref:dysrocplot-text) Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) for univariable logistic regression models to differentiate between left bundle branch block (LBBB) and controls using the circumferential uniformity ratio estimate (CURE) and the systolic stretch index (SSI), respectively. Better discriminatory ability for LBBB is seen for SSI compared to CURE. AUC = area under the ROC curve, CI = confidence interval.

(ref:performanceplot-text) Bar plot showing sensitivity and specificity for detecting left bundle branch block using the systolic stretch index (SSI) and the circumferential uniformity ratio estimate (CURE), respectively. Error bars denote 95% confidence intervals.
