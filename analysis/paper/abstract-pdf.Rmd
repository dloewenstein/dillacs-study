  Aims: More than 90% of patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB) and reduced
  left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction have LV dyssynchrony and a high
  probability of response to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). A subgroup
  of patients with non-specific intraventricular conduction delay (IVCD) have a
  LBBB-like LV activation pattern when studied using invasive mapping and advanced
  echocardiographic techniques. These patients also frequently benefit from CRT
  but these patients have proven difficult to identify using ECG criteria.
  Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging indices of dyssynchrony may
  identify patients with IVCD who may benefit from CRT but their relative
  accuracies for identification of LV dyssynchrony remains unknown. We compared
  the LV dyssynchrony classification accuracy of two commonly available CMR
  indices in a study population of patients with severely reduced LV ejection
  fraction and no scar, and either LBBB or normal conduction (normal QRS duration
  and axis, controls).
  Methods and results: In LBBB (n=44) and controls (n=36), using CMR feature
  tracking circumferential strain, dyssynchrony was quantified as the
  circumferential uniformity ratio estimate (CURE) and the systolic stretch index
  (SSI). Deidentified CMR image-data were made publicly available. Both CURE and
  SSI quantified more severe dyssynchrony in LBBB compared to controls (p<0.001
  for both). SSI more frequently discriminated LBBB and normal conduction LV
  activation patterns than CURE (area under the receiver operating characteristics
  curve [95% confidence interval] 0.98 [0.95-1.00] for SSI vs 0.77 [0.66-0.86] for
  CURE, p<0.001).
  Conclusion: SSI is superior to CURE for discriminating synchronous and
  dyssynchronous LV activation and should be further studied in the setting of
  non-LBBB conduction abnormalities.
