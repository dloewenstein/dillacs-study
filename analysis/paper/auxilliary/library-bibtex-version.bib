Background Epidemiological data suggest that LBBB can provoke heart failure in patients with hypertension. Methods In 11 asymptomatic patients with isolated LBBB and 11 age-matched control subjects, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and global longitudinal strain (GLS) were measured by echocardiography. Systolic arterial pressure was increased by combining pneumatic extremity constrictors and handgrip exercise. To obtain more insight into mechanisms of afterload response, 8 anesthetized dogs with left ventricular (LV) micromanometer and dimension crystals were studied during acutely induced LBBB and aortic constriction. Regional myocardial work was assessed by LV pressure-dimension analysis. Results Consistent with normal afterload dependency, elevation of systolic arterial pressure by 38 {$\pm$} 12 mm Hg moderately reduced LVEF from 60 {$\pm$} 4\% to 54 {$\pm$} 6\% (p {$<$} 0.01) in control subjects. In LBBB patients, however, a similar blood pressure increase caused substantially larger reduction in LVEF (p {$<$} 0.01), from 56 {$\pm$} 6\% to 42 {$\pm$} 7\% (p {$<$} 0.01). There were similar findings for GLS. In the dog model, aortic constriction abolished septal shortening (p {$<$} 0.02), and septal work decreased to negative values (p {$<$} 0.01). Therefore, during elevated systolic pressure, the septum made no contribution to global LV work, as indicated by net negative work, and instead absorbed energy from work done by the LV lateral wall. Conclusions Moderate elevation of arterial pressure caused marked reductions in LVEF and GLS in patients with LBBB. This reflects a cardiodepressive effect of elevated afterload in the dyssynchronous ventricle and was attributed to loss of septal function.},

  abstract = {Objectives This study sought to investigate how regional left ventricular (LV) function modifies septal motion in left~bundle branch block (LBBB). Background In LBBB, the interventricular septum often has marked pre-ejection shortening, followed by immediate relengthening (rebound stretch). This motion, often referred to as septal flash, is associated with positive response to~cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). Methods In 10 anesthetized dogs, we induced LBBB by radiofrequency ablation and occluded the circumflex (CX) (n~= 10) and left anterior descending (LAD) (n~= 6) coronary arteries, respectively. Myocardial dimensions were measured by sonomicrometry and myocardial work by pressure-segment length analysis. In 40 heart failure patients with LBBB, including 20 with post-infarct scar and 20 with nonischemic cardiomyopathy, myocardial strain was measured by speckle-tracking echocardiography and myocardial work by pressure-strain analysis. Scar was assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging with late gadolinium enhancement. Results During LBBB, each animal showed typical septal flash with pre-ejection shortening and rebound stretch, followed by~reduced septal systolic shortening (p~{$<$} 0.01). CX occlusion caused LV lateral wall dysfunction and abolished septal flash due to loss of rebound stretch (p~{$<$} 0.0001). Furthermore, CX occlusion restored septal systolic shortening to a similar level as before induction of LBBB and substantially improved septal work (p~{$<$} 0.001). LAD occlusion, however, accentuated septal flash by increasing rebound stretch (p~{$<$} 0.05). Consistent with the experimental findings, septal flash was absent in patients with LV lateral wall scar due to lack of rebound stretch (p~{$<$} 0.001), and septal systolic shortening and septal work far exceeded values in nonischemic cardiomyopathy (p~{$<$} 0.0001). Septal flash was present in~most patients with anteroseptal scar. Conclusions LV lateral wall dysfunction and scar abolished septal flash and markedly improved septal function in~LBBB. Therefore, function and scar in the LV lateral wall should be taken into account when septal motion is used~to~evaluate dyssynchrony.},

Objective The purpose of this study was to determine whether post-CRT outcome differences in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) relate to intrinsic QRS pattern and/or scar burden. Methods We analyzed 393 consecutive ICM patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) {$\leq$}35\%, QRS duration {$>$}120 ms, and LBBB or nonspecific IVCD who underwent single-photon emission computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging and CRT-defibrillator implant. We compared scar burden; QRS duration; LVEF change; risk of death, transplant, or ventricular assist device; and risk of appropriate device shocks between LBBB and IVCD patients, using multivariable analyses to determine relative associations between QRS pattern vs scar burden and outcomes. Results Nonspecific IVCD is associated with greater scar burden and narrower baseline QRS duration than LBBB. IVCD patients demonstrated less QRS narrowing with CRT than LBBB patients, even when excluding IVCD patients with QRS duration {$<$}150 ms. LVEF improved less in patients with IVCD vs LBBB, but only scar burden not QRS morphology or duration was associated with LVEF increase {$\geq$}5\%. During 39-month follow-up, IVCD was associated with shorter survival free from transplant/ventricular assist device and shorter time to first appropriate device shock. Scar burden but not QRS morphology was independently associated with these outcomes on multivariate analysis. Conclusion IVCD is associated with greater scar burden than LBBB in ICM CRT-defibrillator recipients. Scar burden, not QRS pattern, is independently associated with adverse clinical outcomes.},

We examined evidence for improved CRT outcomes when LV lead placement concordant with latest mechanical activation occurred. Methods A review of EMBASE and PubMed was performed for randomized controlled trials or prospective observational studies from October 2008 through October 2020 comparing outcomes with concordant versus discordant LV lead placement. Meta-analyses were performed to assess the association between concordance and death, death or heart failure (HF) hospitalization, {$\geq$} 15\% reduction in LV end systolic volume (LVESV), and changes in LVESV or ejection fraction (LVEF). Results From 5897 citations, nine publications (eight studies) with 1355 patients were selected; 975 with a concordant LV lead and 380 with a discordant lead. Mean age was 66\textendash 68 years, 82\% were male, and 64\% had ischemic cardiomyopathy. Meta-analyses demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in death/HF hospitalization at 2 years (OR 0.38; 95\% CI 0.16, 0.92) and LVESV at 6 months (mean difference [MD] -13.4\%; 95\% CI -6.7\%, -20.0\%), and an increase in LVEF (MD 4.03; 95\% CI 0.77, 7.30) with the concordant LV lead. There were trends toward decreased death at 2 years (OR 0.49; 95\% CI 0.19, 1.23) and {$\geq$} 15\% reduction in LVESV at 6 months (OR 3.81; 95\% CI 0.24, 61.24) with concordant LV lead placement. Conclusion A concordant LV lead was associated with better CRT outcomes. Further study of feasible methods to achieve LV lead concordance is needed.},

Feature tracking is a promising quantitative post-processing technique that is increasingly used. It is commonly applied to cine images, in particular steady-state free precession, acquired during routine CMR examinations.Objective:To review the studies that have used feature tracking techniques in healthy subjects or patients with cardiovascular diseases. The article emphasizes the advantages and limitations of feature tracking when applied to regional deformation parameters. The challenges of applying the techniques in clinics and potential solutions are also reviewed.Results:Research studies in healthy volunteers and/or patients either applied CMR-feature tracking alone to assess myocardial motion or compared it with either established CMR-tagging techniques or to speckle tracking echocardiography. These studies assessed the feasibility and reliability of calculating or determining global and regional myocardial deformation strain parameters. Regional deformation parameters are reviewed and compared. Better reproducibility for global deformation was observed compared with segmental parameters. Overall, studies demonstrated that circumferential was the most reproducible deformation parameter, usually followed by longitudinal strain; in contrast, radial strain showed high variability.Conclusion:Although feature tracking is a promising tool, there are still discrepancies in the results obtained using different software packages. This highlights a clear need for standardization of MRI acquisition parameters and feature tracking analysis methodologies. Validation, including physical and numerical phantoms, is still required to facilitate the use of feature tracking in routine clinical practice.},

We review methods that can be applied during or after data analysis to adjust for uncontrolled confounding for different outcomes, confounders, and study settings.

Identification of factors that predict disease progression is needed to refine guidelines on initiation and cessation of enzyme replacement therapy. To study the association of potential biochemical and clinical prognostic factors with the disease course (clinical events, progression of cardiac and renal disease) we retrospectively evaluated 293 treated patients from three international centers of excellence. As expected, age, sex and phenotype were important predictors of event rate. Clinical events before enzyme replacement therapy, cardiac mass and eGFR at baseline predicted an increased event rate. eGFR was the most important predictor: hazard ratios increased from 2 at eGFR {$<$}90 ml/min/1.73m2 to 4 at eGFR {$<$}30, compared to patients with an eGFR {$>$}90. In addition, men with classical disease and a baseline eGFR {$<$}60 ml/min/1.73m2 had a faster yearly decline (-2.0 ml/min/1.73m2) than those with a baseline eGFR of {$>$}60. Proteinuria was a further independent risk factor for decline in eGFR. Increased cardiac mass at baseline was associated with the most robust decrease in cardiac mass during treatment, while presence of cardiac fibrosis predicted a stronger increase in cardiac mass (3.36 gram/m2/year). Of other cardiovascular risk factors, hypertension significantly predicted the risk for clinical events.

Primary end points were all-cause mortality, cardiac mortality, and arrhythmic death. Prolonged QRS duration was defined as QRS {$\geq$}110 ms and intraventricular conduction delay as QRS {$\geq$}110 ms, without the criteria of complete or incomplete bundle-branch block. QRS duration {$\geq$}110 ms was present in 1.3\% (n=147) and intraventricular conduction delay in 0.6\% (n=67) of the subjects. Prolonged QRS duration predicted all-cause mortality (multivariate-adjusted relative risk [RR] 1.48; 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.22\textendash 1.81; P{$<$}0.001), cardiac mortality (RR 1.94; CI 1.44\textendash 2.63; P{$<$}0.001), and sudden arrhythmic death (RR 2.14; CI 1.38\textendash 3.33; P=0.002).

  abstract = {Purpose To image late mechanical activation and identify effective left-ventricular (LV) pacing sites for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). There is variability in defining mechanical activation time, with some studies using the time to peak strain (TPS) and some using the time to the onset of circumferential shortening (TOS). We developed improved methods for imaging mechanical activation and evaluated them in heart failure (HF) patients undergoing CRT. Materials and Methods We applied active contours to cine displacement encoding with stimulated echoes (DENSE) strain images to detect TOS. Six healthy volunteers underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 1.5T, and 50 patients underwent pre-CRT MRI (strain, scar, volumes) and echocardiography, assessment of the electrical activation time (Q-LV) at the LV pacing site, and echocardiography assessment of LV reverse remodeling 6 months after CRT. TPS at the LV pacing site was also measured by DENSE. Results The latest TOS was greater in HF patients vs. healthy subjects (112 {$\pm$} 28 msec vs. 61 {$\pm$} 7 msec, P {$<$} 0.01). The correlation between TOS and Q-LV was strong (r {$>$} 0.75; P {$<$} 0.001) and better than between TPS and Q-LV (r {$<$} 0.62; P {$\geq$} 0.006). Twenty-three of 50 patients had the latest activating segment in a region other than the mid-ventricular lateral wall, the most common site for the CRT LV lead. Using a multivariable model, TOS/QRS was significantly associated with LV reverse remodeling even after adjustment for overall dyssynchrony and scar (P {$<$} 0.05), whereas TPS was not (P = 0.49). Conclusion Late activation by cine DENSE TOS analysis is associated with improved LV reverse remodeling with CRT and deserves further study as a tool to achieve optimal LV lead placement in CRT.

Although the therapy was developed 30~years ago and approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2001, attempts to improve it have never stopped. Such improvements have been facilitated by combining knowledge from bench (basic science), bits (computer modeling), and bedside (clinical studies); these issues are addressed in the present review. Improvements include better patient~selection, positioning of the LV lead, pacing from multiple sites, and optimization of atrioventricular and ventriculo-ventricular intervals. Overall, patterns of electrocardiographic and echocardiographic (strain) signals appear to be more useful for patient selection than timing intervals (QRS duration, time-to-peak shortening). Quadripolar leads~have significantly improved CRT outcome due to increased electrical and mechanical lead performance (avoiding phrenic nerve stimulation and improving lead stability), but also thanks to the flexibility offered by the novel leads to avoid in-scar pacing. The benefit of multiple site stimulation over optimal conventional biventricular pacing seems small and is awaiting evidence from large trials. There is rapidly growing interest in merging imaging information to guide positioning of the LV lead in late activated regions without scar and in LV lead positions other than the epicardial coronary~veins (LV~endocardium, His bundle, LV septum). All these developments look promising but await further clinical validation. Finally, computer modeling is rapidly becoming important in understanding the substrate for CRT, in improving and assisting patient selection, as well as in guiding therapy planning.},

The objective of this study was to determine the reproducibility of logistic regression models developed using automated variable selection methods. Study Design and Setting: An initial set of 29 candidate variables were considered for predicting mortality after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). We drew 1,000 bootstrap samples from a dataset consisting of 4,911 patients admitted to hospital with an AMI. Using each bootstrap sample, logistic regression models predicting 30-day mortality were obtained using backward elimination, forward selection, and stepwise selection. The agreement between the different model selection methods and the agreement across the 1,000 bootstrap samples were compared. Results: Using 1,000 bootstrap samples, backward elimination identified 940 unique models for predicting mortality. Similar results were obtained for forward and stepwise selection. Three variables were identified as independent predictors of mortality among all bootstrap samples. Over half the candidate prognostic variables were identified as independent predictors in less than half of the bootstrap samples. Conclusion: Automated variable selection methods result in models that are unstable and not reproducible. The variables selected as independent predictors are sensitive to random fluctuations in the data. \'C 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Many non-experimental studies use propensity-score methods to estimate causal effects by balancing treatment and control groups on a set of observed baseline covariates. Full matching on the propensity score has emerged as a particularly effective and flexible method for utilizing all available data, and creating well-balanced treatment and comparison groups. However, full matching has been used infrequently with binary outcomes, and relatively little work has investigated the performance of full matching when estimating effects on binary outcomes. This paper describes methods that can be used for estimating the effect of treatment on binary outcomes when using full matching. It then used Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the performance of these methods based on full matching (with and without a caliper), and compared their performance with that of nearest neighbour matching (with and without a caliper) and inverse probability of treatment weighting. The simulations varied the prevalence of the treatment and the strength of association between the covariates and treatment assignment. Results indicated that all of the approaches work well when the strength of confounding is relatively weak. With stronger confounding, the relative performance of the methods varies, with nearest neighbour matching with a caliper showing consistently good performance across a wide range of settings. We illustrate the approaches using a study estimating the effect of inpatient smoking cessation counselling on survival following hospitalization for a heart attack.},

  abstract = {Predicting the probability of the occurrence of a binary outcome or condition is important in biomedical research. While assessing discrimination is an essential issue in developing and validating binary prediction models, less attention has been paid to methods for assessing model calibration. Calibration refers to the degree of agreement between observed and predicted probabilities and is often assessed by testing for lack-of-fit. The objective of our study was to examine the ability of graphical methods to assess the calibration of logistic regression models. We examined lack of internal calibration, which was related to misspecification of the logistic regression model, and external calibration, which was related to an overfit model or to shrinkage of the linear predictor. We conducted an extensive set of Monte Carlo simulations with a locally weighted least squares regression smoother (i.e., the loess algorithm) to examine the ability of graphical methods to assess model calibration. We found that loess-based methods were able to provide evidence of moderate departures from linearity and indicate omission of a moderately strong interaction. Misspecification of the link function was harder to detect. Visual patterns were clearer with higher sample sizes, higher incidence of the outcome, or higher discrimination. Loess-based methods were also able to identify the lack of calibration in external validation samples when an overfit regression model had been used. In conclusion, loess-based smoothing methods are adequate tools to graphically assess calibration and merit wider application. ? 2013 The Authors.

We aimed to describe and evaluate methods for graphically assessing the calibration of survival models. We focus on hazard regression models and restricted cubic splines in conjunction with a Cox proportional hazards model. We also describe modifications of the Integrated Calibration Index, of E50 and of E90. In this context, this is the average (respectively, median or 90th percentile) absolute difference between predicted survival probabilities and smoothed survival frequencies. We conducted a series of Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the performance of these calibration measures when the underlying model has been correctly specified and under different types of model mis-specification. We illustrate the utility of calibration curves and the three calibration metrics by using them to compare the calibration of a Cox proportional hazards regression model with that of a random survival forest for predicting mortality in patients hospitalized with heart failure. Under a correctly specified regression model, differences between the two methods for constructing calibration curves were minimal, although the performance of the method based on restricted cubic splines tended to be slightly better. In contrast, under a mis-specified model, the smoothed calibration curved constructed using hazard regression tended to be closer to the true calibration curve. The use of calibration curves and of these numeric calibration metrics permits for a comprehensive comparison of the calibration of competing survival models.},

  abstract = {The propensity score is defined as a subject's probability of treatment selection, conditional on observed baseline covariates. Weighting subjects by the inverse probability of treatment received creates a synthetic sample in which treatment assignment is independent of measured baseline covariates. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) using the propensity score allows one to obtain unbiased estimates of average treatment effects. However, these estimates are only valid if there are no residual systematic differences in observed baseline characteristics between treated and control subjects in the sample weighted by the estimated inverse probability of treatment. We report on a systematic literature review, in which we found that the use of IPTW has increased rapidly in recent years, but that in the most recent year, a majority of studies did not formally examine whether weighting balanced measured covariates between treatment groups. We then proceed to describe a suite of quantitative and qualitative methods that allow one to assess whether measured baseline covariates are balanced between treatment groups in the weighted sample. The quantitative methods use the weighted standardized difference to compare means, prevalences, higher-order moments, and interactions. The qualitative methods employ graphical methods to compare the distribution of continuous baseline covariates between treated and control subjects in the weighted sample. Finally, we illustrate the application of these methods in an empirical case study. We propose a formal set of balance diagnostics that contribute towards an evolving concept of `best practice' when using IPTW to estimate causal treatment effects using observational data. \textcopyright{} 2015 The Authors.

  abstract = {Matching on the propensity score is a commonly used analytic method for estimating the effects of treatments on outcomes. Commonly used propensity score matching methods include nearest neighbor matching and nearest neighbor caliper matching. Rosenbaum (1991) proposed an optimal full matching approach, in which matched strata are formed consisting of either one treated subject and at least one control subject or one control subject and at least one treated subject. Full matching has been used rarely in the applied literature. Furthermore, its performance for use with survival outcomes has not been rigorously evaluated. We propose a method to use full matching to estimate the effect of treatment on the hazard of the occurrence of the outcome. An extensive set of Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to examine the performance of optimal full matching with survival analysis. Its performance was compared with that of nearest neighbor matching, nearest neighbor caliper matching, and inverse probability of treatment weighting using the propensity score. Full matching has superior performance compared with that of the two other matching algorithms and had comparable performance with that of inverse probability of treatment weighting using the propensity score. We illustrate the application of full matching with survival outcomes to estimate the effect of statin prescribing at hospital discharge on the hazard of post-discharge mortality in a large cohort of patients who were discharged from hospital with a diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction. Optimal full matching merits more widespread adoption in medical and epidemiological research. \textcopyright{} 2015 The Authors. Statistics in Medicine Published by John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

  abstract = {There is increasing interest in estimating the causal effects of treatments using observational data. Propensity-score matching methods are frequently used to adjust for differences in observed characteristics between treated and control individuals in observational studies. Survival or time-to-event outcomes occur frequently in the medical literature, but the use of propensity score methods in survival analysis has not been thoroughly investigated. This paper compares two approaches for estimating the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) on survival outcomes: Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting (IPTW) and full matching. The performance of these methods was compared in an extensive set of simulations that varied the extent of confounding and the amount of misspecification of the propensity score model. We found that both IPTW and full matching resulted in estimation of marginal hazard ratios with negligible bias when the ATE was the target estimand and the treatment-selection process was weak to moderate. However, when the treatment-selection process was strong, both methods resulted in biased estimation of the true marginal hazard ratio, even when the propensity score model was correctly specified. When the propensity score model was correctly specified, bias tended to be lower for full matching than for IPTW. The reasons for these biases and for the differences between the two methods appeared to be due to some extreme weights generated for each method. Both methods tended to produce more extreme weights as the magnitude of the effects of covariates on treatment selection increased. Furthermore, more extreme weights were observed for IPTW than for full matching. However, the poorer performance of both methods in the presence of a strong treatment-selection process was mitigated by the use of IPTW with restriction and full matching with a caliper restriction when the propensity score model was correctly specified.},

  abstract = {Propensity score methods are increasingly being used to estimate causal treatment effects in observational studies. In medical and epidemiological studies, outcomes are frequently time-to-event in nature. Propensity-score methods are often applied incorrectly when estimating the effect of treatment on time-to-event outcomes. This article describes how two different propensity score methods (matching and inverse probability of treatment weighting) can be used to estimate the measures of effect that are frequently reported in randomized controlled trials: (i) marginal survival curves, which describe survival in the population if all subjects were treated or if all subjects were untreated; and (ii) marginal hazard ratios. The use of these propensity score methods allows one to replicate the measures of effect that are commonly reported in randomized controlled trials with time-to-event outcomes: both absolute and relative reductions in the probability of an event occurring can be determined. We also provide guidance on variable selection for the propensity score model, highlight methods for assessing the balance of baseline covariates between treated and untreated subjects, and describe the implementation of a sensitivity analysis to assess the effect of unmeasured confounding variables on the estimated treatment effect when outcomes are time-to-event in nature. The methods in the paper are illustrated by estimating the effect of discharge statin prescribing on the risk of death in a sample of patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction. In this tutorial article, we describe and illustrate all the steps necessary to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the effect of treatment on time-to-event outcomes. \textcopyright{} 2013 The authors.

  abstract = {Propensity score methods are used to reduce the effects of observed confounding when using observational data to estimate the effects of treatments or exposures. A popular method of using the propensity score is inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW). When using this method, a weight is calculated for each subject that is equal to the inverse of the probability of receiving the treatment that was actually received. These weights are then incorporated into the analyses to minimize the effects of observed confounding. Previous research has found that these methods result in unbiased estimation when estimating the effect of treatment on survival outcomes. However, conventional methods of variance estimation were shown to result in biased estimates of standard error. In this study, we conducted an extensive set of Monte Carlo simulations to examine different methods of variance estimation when using a weighted Cox proportional hazards model to estimate the effect of treatment. We considered three variance estimation methods: (i) a na\"ive model-based variance estimator; (ii) a robust sandwich-type variance estimator; and (iii) a bootstrap variance estimator. We considered estimation of both the average treatment effect and the average treatment effect in the treated. We found that the use of a bootstrap estimator resulted in approximately correct estimates of standard errors and confidence intervals with the correct coverage rates. The other estimators resulted in biased estimates of standard errors and confidence intervals with incorrect coverage rates. Our simulations were informed by a case study examining the effect of statin prescribing on mortality. \textcopyright{} 2016 The Authors. Statistics in Medicine published by John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

  abstract = {Introduction The relationship between left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) and LV myocardial scar can identify potentially reversible causes of LV dysfunction. Left bundle branch block (LBBB) alters the electrical and mechanical activation of the LV. We hypothesized that the relationship between LVEF and scar extent is different in LBBB compared to controls. Methods We compared the relationship between LVEF and scar burden between patients with LBBB and scar (n\,=\,83), and patients with chronic ischemic heart disease and scar but no electrocardiographic conduction abnormality (controls, n\,=\,90), who had undergone cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging at one of three centers. LVEF (\%) was measured in CMR cine images. Scar burden was quantified by CMR late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and expressed as \% of LV mass (\%LVM). Maximum possible LVEF (LVEFmax) was defined as the function describing the hypotenuse in the LVEF versus myocardial scar extent scatter plot. Dysfunction index was defined as LVEFmax derived from the control cohort minus the measured LVEF. Results Compared to controls with scar, LBBB with scar had a lower LVEF (median [interquartile range] 27 [19\textendash 38] vs 36 [25\textendash 50] \%, p\,{$<$}\,0.001), smaller scar (4 [1\textendash 9] vs 11 [6\textendash 20] \%LVM, p\,{$<$}\,0.001), and greater dysfunction index (39 [30\textendash 52] vs 21 [12\textendash 35] \% points, p\,{$<$}\,0.001). Conclusions Among LBBB patients referred for CMR, LVEF is disproportionately reduced in relation to the amount of scar. Dyssynchrony in LBBB may thus impair compensation for loss of contractile myocardium.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The present study aims to evaluate the diagnostic value of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) feature tracking (FT) derived strain-analysis of both ventricles in patients with acute myocarditis (ACM) in order to improve its currently still challenging non-invasive diagnosis. METHODS: CMR cine data of 31 patients with clinically suspected ACM and confirmation of diagnosis by CMR according to the Lake Louise criteria as well as 14 patients with clinically diagnosed ACM but inconspicuous CMR were retrospectively analyzed. 20 healthy volunteers (HV) served as a control. Analysis of global longitudinal, circumferential and radial strain and strain rate of both ventricles was performed in one long-axis and three short-axis slices using a dedicated FT-software (TomTec Imaging Systems). RESULTS: Patients with ACM showed significantly reduced LV longitudinal strain (-12.7 +/- 6.5 vs. -16.8 +/- 5.9\%, p=0.021) and LV circumferential strain (LVCirStrain; -22.9 +/- 5.7 vs. -27.8 +/- 4.4 \%, p{$<$}0.001) compared to HV. Conversely, they showed improved basal RV circumferential strain rate (BasalRVCirSR; -0.70 +/- 0.23 vs. -0.47 +/- 0.31s(-1), p=0.009). In ACM patients with preserved EF, BasalRVCirSR was significantly increased compared to HV while LV strain was not significantly different between both groups. In multinominal logistic regression analysis, LVCirStrain and BasalRVCirSR proved to be the best independent predictors of ACM with preserved EF. A combined cut-off of -0.53s(-1) for BasalRVCirSR and of -29.0\% for LVCirStrain allowed a classification of ACM patients with preserved EF with a sensitivity of 89\% and a specificity of 80\%. Also patients with clinical ACM but inconspicuous CMR showed a significantly improved BasalRVCirSR and a cut-off of -0.77s(-1) allowed a classification of ACM patients with a sensitivity of 70\% and a specificity of 90\%, while all other CMR parameters were normal. CONCLUSIONS: The defined cut-offs for LVCirStrain and BasalRVCirSR allow a prediction of ACM with high sensitivity and specificity, even in patients with preserved EF and in patients with otherwise completely inconspicuous CMR. Our results point to a discriminative power especially of RV strain analysis in the CMR-based diagnosis of ACM.},

Recent developments in subgroup analysis consider subgroups that are defined in terms of the predicted individual treatment effect, i.e. the difference between the predicted outcome under treatment and the predicted outcome under control for each individual, which in turn may depend on multiple biomarkers. In this work, we study the properties of different modelling strategies to estimate the predicted individual treatment effect. We explore linear models and compare different estimation methods, such as maximum likelihood and the Lasso with and without randomized response. For the latter, we implement confidence intervals based on the selective inference framework to account for the model selection stage. We illustrate the methods in a dataset of a treatment for Alzheimer disease (normal response) and in a dataset of a treatment for prostate cancer (survival outcome). We also evaluate via simulations the performance of using the predicted individual treatment effect to identify subgroups where a novel treatment leads to better outcomes compared to a control treatment.},

Six patients withdrew before reaching an end point: 3 to receive commercial therapy and 3 due to positive or inconclusive serum IgE or skin test results. Three patients assigned to agalsidase beta elected to transition to open-label treatment before reaching an end point.Results:Thirteen (42\%) of the 31 patients in the placebo group and 14 (27\%) of the 51 patients in the agalsidase-beta group experienced clinical events. Primary intention-to-treat analysis that adjusted for an imbalance in baseline proteinuria showed that, compared with placebo, agalsidase beta delayed the time to first clinical event (hazard ratio, 0.47 [95\% CI, 0.21 to 1.03]; P~= 0.06). Secondary analyses of protocol-adherent patients showed similar results (hazard ratio, 0.39 [CI, 0.16 to 0.93]; P~= 0.034). Ancillary subgroup analyses found larger treatment effects in patients with baseline estimated glomerular filtration rates greater than 55 mL/min per 1.73 m2 (hazard ratio, 0.19 [CI, 0.05 to 0.82]; P~= 0.025) compared with 55 mL/min per 1.73 m2 or less (hazard ratio, 0.85 [CI, 0.32 to 2.3]; P~= 0.75) (formal test for interaction, P~= 0.09). Most treatment-related adverse events were mild or moderate infusion-associated reactions, reported by 55\% of patients in the agalsidase-beta group and 23\% of patients in the placebo group.Limitations:The study sample was small. Only one third of the patients experienced clinical events, and some patients withdrew before experiencing any event.Conclusions:Agalsidase-beta therapy slowed progression to the composite clinical outcome of renal, cardiac, and cerebrovascular complications and death compared with placebo in patients with advanced Fabry disease. Therapeutic intervention before irreversible organ damage may provide greater clinical benefit.*For a list of members of the Fabry Disease Clinical Trial Study Group, see the Appendix.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00074984.},

We wish to do so while offering   finite-sample guarantees about the fraction of false   positives---selected variables \$X\_j\$ that in fact have no effect on   \$Y\$ after the other features are known.  When the number of features   \$p\$ is large (perhaps even larger than the sample size \$n\$), and we   have no prior knowledge regarding the type of dependence between \$Y\$   and \$X\$, the model-X knockoffs framework nonetheless allows us to   select a model with a guaranteed bound on the false discovery rate,   as long as the distribution of the feature vector   \$X=(X\_1,\textbackslash dots,X\_p)\$ is exactly known. This model selection procedure   operates by constructing ``knockoff copies'' of each of the \$p\$   features, which are then used as a control group to ensure that the   model selection algorithm is not choosing too many irrelevant   features.  In this work, we study the practical setting where the   distribution of \$X\$ can only be estimated, rather than known   exactly, and the knockoff copies of the \$X\_j\$'s are therefore   constructed somewhat incorrectly.  Our results, which are free of   any modeling assumption whatsoever, show that the resulting model   selection procedure incurs an inflation of the false discovery rate   that is proportional to our errors in estimating the distribution of   each feature \$X\_j\$ conditional on the remaining features   \$\textbackslash\{X\_k:k\textbackslash neq j\textbackslash\}\$.  The model-X knockoffs framework is therefore robust to errors in the underlying assumptions on the distribution of \$X\$, making it an effective method for many practical applications, such as genome-wide association studies, where the underlying distribution on the features \$X\_1,\textbackslash dots,X\_p\$ is estimated accurately but not known exactly.},

However, when using a ``10-second median beat'' for analysis, the reported mean values for TWRrel vary widely and parameter reproducibility is somewhat suspect. In repeated electrocardiographic recordings conducted 1 month and 1 year apart on 15 and 27 healthy individuals, respectively, we studied the said T-wave morphology parameters in single complexes and in reduced noise signal averages containing 10 and 200 complexes. Considering all subjects, the mean ({$\pm$}SD) TWRrel was highest in a single complex (0.0345\% {$\pm$} 0.0183\%), intermediate in the 10-beat signal-averaged complexes (0.0125\% {$\pm$} 0.0051\%), and lowest in the 200-beat signal-averaged complexes (0.0078\% {$\pm$} 0.0036\%) (P {$<$} .0001), with the same trend also observed in the TWRabs but not in the principal component analysis ratio. Reproducibility as quantified by within-subject variance and reliability as quantified by the intraclass (intrasubject) correlation coefficient also improved as the number of T-wave complexes analyzed increased. We conclude that signal averages consisting of more than 10 complexes (or more than 10 seconds worth of complexes) are required to produce reproducible and reliable values for TWRrel and TWRabs.},

Cardiac resynchronization therapy improves HF symptoms, exercise capacity, and left ventricular (LV) function. Because not all patients respond, preimplantation identification of responders is needed. In the present study, response to CRT was predicted by the presence of LV dyssynchrony assessed by tissue Doppler imaging. Moreover, the prognostic value of LV dyssynchrony in patients undergoing CRT was assessed. Eighty-five patients with end-stage HF, QRS duration \&gt;120 ms, and left bundle-branch block were evaluated by tissue Doppler imaging before CRT. At baseline and six months follow-up, New York Heart Association functional class, quality of life and 6-min walking distance, LV volumes, and LV ejection fraction were determined. Events (death, hospitalization for decompensated HF) were obtained during one-year follow-up. Responders (74\%) and nonresponders (26\%) had comparable baseline characteristics, except for a larger dyssynchrony in responders (87 {$\pm$} 49 ms vs. 35 {$\pm$} 20 ms, p \&lt; 0.01). Receiver-operator characteristic curve analysis demonstrated that an optimal cutoff value of 65 ms for LV dyssynchrony yielded a sensitivity and specificity of 80\% to predict clinical improvement and of 92\% to predict LV reverse remodeling. Patients with dyssynchrony {$\geq$}65 ms had an excellent prognosis (6\% event rate) after CRT as compared with a 50\% event rate in patients with dyssynchrony \&lt;65 ms (p \&lt; 0.001).

  abstract = {Outcomes from 5years of treatment with agalsidase alfa enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for Fabry disease in patients enrolled in the Fabry Outcome Survey (FOS) were compared with published findings for untreated patients with Fabry disease. Data were extracted from FOS, a Shire-sponsored database, for comparison with data from three published studies. Outcomes evaluated were the annualized rate of change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and left ventricular mass indexed to height (LVMI) as well as time to and ages at a composite morbidity endpoint and at death. FOS data were extracted for 740 treated patients who were followed for a median of \textasciitilde{} 5years. Compared with no treatment, patients treated with agalsidase alfa demonstrated slower decline in renal function and slower progression of left ventricular hypertrophy. Treated male patients with baseline eGFR {$<$}60mL/min/1.73m2 had a mean (standard error of the mean [SEM]) annualized change in eGFR of -2.86 (0.53) mL/min/1.73m2/y compared with -6.8 (1.5) in the published untreated cohort. The mean (SEM) rate of LVMI increase with treatment was 0.33 (0.10) g/m2.7/y in males and 0.48 (0.09) in females, compared with 4.07 (1.03) in untreated males and 2.31 (0.81) in untreated females. Morbidity occurred later in treated patients, with \textasciitilde 16\% risk of a composite morbidity event (26\% in males) after 24months with ERT versus \textasciitilde 45\% without treatment, with first events and deaths also occurring at older ages in patients administered ERT (e.g., estimated median survival in treated males was 77.5years versus 60years in untreated males). Findings from these retrospective comparisons of observational data and published literature support the long-term benefits of ERT with agalsidase alfa for Fabry disease in slowing the progression of renal impairment and cardiomyopathy. Treatment also appeared to delay the onset of morbidity and mortality. Interpretation of these findings should take into account that they are based on retrospective comparisons with previously published data.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study sought to test the feasibility of a purpose-built, integrated software platform to process, analyze, and overlay cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) data in real time within a combined cardiac catheter laboratory and magnetic resonance imaging scanner suite (X-MRI) to guide left ventricular (LV) lead implantation. BACKGROUND: Suboptimal LV lead position is a major determinant of poor cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) response, and the optimal site is highly patient specific. Pacing myocardial scar is associated with poorer outcomes; conversely, targeting latest mechanical activation (LMA) may improve them. METHODS: Fourteen patients (age 74 {$\pm$} 5.1 years; New York Heart Association functional class: 2.7 {$\pm$} 0.4; 86\% ischemic with ejection fraction 27 {$\pm$} 7.6\%; QRSd: 157 {$\pm$} 19 ms) underwent CMR followed by immediate CRT implantation using derived scar and dyssynchrony data, overlaid onto fluoroscopy in an X-MRI suite. Rapid LV segmentation enabled detailed scar quantification, identification of LMA segments, and selection of myocardial targets. At coronary venography, the CMR-derived 3-dimensional shell was fused, enabling identification of viable venous targets subtended by target segments for LV lead placement. RESULTS: The platform was successful in all 14 patients, of whom 10 (71\%) were paced in pre-procedurally defined target segments. Pacing in CMR-defined target segments (out of scar) showed a significant decrease in the LV capture threshold (mean difference: 2.4 [1.5 to 3.2]; p~{$<$} 0.001) and shorter paced QRS duration (mean difference: 25 [15 to 34]; p~{$<$} 0.001) compared with pacing in areas of CMR determined scar. In 5 (36\%) patients with extensive scar in the posterolateral wall, CMR guidance enabled successful lead delivery in an alternative anatomically favorable site. Radiation dose and implant times were similar to historical controls (p~= NS). CONCLUSIONS: Real-time CMR-guided LV lead placement is feasible and achievable in a single clinical setting and~may~prove helpful to preferentially select sites for LV lead placement.},

  abstract = {Most machine learning researchers perform quantitative experiments to estimate generalization error and compare the performance of different algorithms (in particular, their proposed algorithm). In order to be able to draw statistically convincing conclusions, it is important to estimate the uncertainty of such estimates. This paper studies the very commonly used K-fold cross-validation estimator of generalization performance. The main theorem shows that there exists no universal (valid under all distributions) unbiased estimator of the variance of K-fold cross-validation. The analysis that accompanies this result is based on the eigen-decomposition of the covariance matrix of errors, which has only three different eigenvalues corresponding to three degrees of freedom of the matrix and three components of the total variance. This analysis helps to better understand the nature of the problem and how it can make naive estimators (that don't take into account the error correlations due to the overlap between training and test sets) grossly underestimate variance. This is confirmed by numerical experiments in which the three components of the variance are compared when the difficulty of the learning problem and the number of folds are varied.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) has proved to be effective in patients with heart failure and left bundle branch block (LBBB). Recently, new electrocardiography criteria have been proposed for the diagnosis of LBBB. These criteria are stricter than the current American Heart Association (AHA) criteria. We assessed the rate of echocardiographic response to CRT in patients with traditional LBBB versus patients who met the new criteria (strict LBBB). METHODS: Consecutive patients undergoing CRT were enrolled in the CRT MORE registry. Patients with no-LBBB QRS morphology according to AHA criteria, atrial fibrillation, right bundle branch block, and right ventricular pacing were excluded. Strict LBBB was defined as: QRS {$\geq$} 140~ms for men and {$\geq$}130 ms for women, QS or rS in V1-V2, mid-QRS notching or slurring in {$\geq$}2 contiguous leads. Patients showing a relative decrease of {$\geq$}15\% in left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESV) at 12 months were defined as responders. RESULTS: Among 335 patients with LBBB, 131 (39\%) had strict LBBB. Patients with and without strict LBBB showed comparable baseline characteristics, except for QRS duration (166 {$\pm$} 20 ms vs 152 {$\pm$} 25 ms, P {$<$} 0.001). On 12-month evaluation, 205 patients (61\%) were responders; 85 of 131 (65\%) had strict LBBB and 120 of 204 (59\%) had traditional LBBB (P = 0.267). On multivariate analysis, a history of atrial fibrillation, larger LVESV, and the presence of mid-QRS notching in {$\geq$}1 lead (odds ratio 2.099; 95\% confidence interval 1.061-4.152, P = 0.033) were independently associated with echocardiographic response. CONCLUSION: Stricter definition of LBBB did not improve response to CRT in comparison to the current AHA definition.},

Some patients with narrow QRS complexes have echocardiographic evidence of left ventricular mechanical dyssynchrony and may also benefit from CRT. Methods We enrolled 172 patients who had a standard indication for an implantable cardioverter\textendash defibrillator. Patients received the CRT device and were randomly assigned to the CRT group or to a control group (no CRT) for 6 months. The primary end point was the proportion of patients with an increase in peak oxygen consumption of at least 1.0 ml per kilogram of body weight per minute during cardiopulmonary exercise testing at 6 months. Results At 6 months, the CRT group and the control group did not differ significantly in the proportion of patients with the primary end point (46\% and 41\%, respectively). In a prespecified subgroup with a QRS interval of 120 msec or more, the peak oxygen consumption increased in the CRT group (P\,=\,0.02), but it was unchanged in a subgroup with a QRS interval of less than 120 msec (P\,=\,0.45). There were 24 heartfailure events requiring intravenous therapy in 14 patients in the CRT group (16.1\%) and 41 events in 19 patients in the control group (22.3\%), but the difference was not significant.

CMR was also used to quantify the degree of left-ventricular mechanical dyssynchrony by deriving the circumferential uniformity ratio estimate (CURE-SVD) parameter from displacement encoding with stimulated echoes (DENSE) strain imaging. Statistical methods included multivariable linear regression with evaluation of interaction effects associated with sex and cardiomyopathy type (ischemic and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy) and survival analysis.ResultsAmong 200 patients, the 54 female patients (27\%) pre-CRT had a smaller CMR-based LVEDVI (p = 0.04), more mechanical dyssynchrony based on the validated CMR CURE-SVD parameter (p = 0.04), a lower frequency of both late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and ischemic cardiomyopathy (p {$<$} 0.0001), a greater RVEF (p = 0.02), and a greater frequency of LBBB (p = 0.01). After categorization of patients into four groups based on cardiomyopathy type (ischemic/non-ischemic cardiomyopathy) and sex, female patients with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy had the lowest CURE-SVD (p = 0.003), the lowest pre-CRT BNP levels (p = 0.01), the lowest post-CRT BNP levels (p = 0.05), and the most favorable LVESVI-FC (p = 0.001). Overall, female patients had better 3-year survival before adjustment for cardiomyopathy type (p = 0.007, HR = 0.45) and after adjustment for cardiomyopathy type (p = 0.009, HR = 0.67).ConclusionCMR identifies distinct phenotypes of female CRT patients with non-ischemic and ischemic cardiomyopathy relative to male patients stratified by cardiomyopathy type. The more favorable short-term response and long-term survival outcomes in female heart failure patients with CRT were associated with lower indexed CMR-based LV volumes, decreased presence of scar associated with prior myocardial infarction and ICM, and greater CMR-based dyssynchrony with the CURE-SVD.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Patients with end-stage heart failure and a wide QRS complex are considered candidates for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). However, 20\% to 30\% of patients do not respond to CRT. Lack of left ventricular dyssynchrony may explain the nonresponse. Accordingly, we evaluated the presence of left ventricular dyssynchrony using tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) in 90 consecutive patients with heart failure. Methods and Results: Ninety patients with severe heart failure (left ventricular ejection fraction {$<$}35\%, New York Heart Association class III\textendash IV) were prospectively evaluated. Based on QRS duration, 30 consecutive patients with a narrow QRS complex were included (QRS duration {$\leq$}120 ms), 30 patients with an intermediate QRS duration (120\textendash 150 ms), and 30 patients with a wide QRS complex ({$>$}150 ms). All patients underwent TDI to assess left ventricular dyssynchrony. Extensive left ventricular dyssynchrony was defined as an electromechanical delay on TDI between the septum and lateral wall, the so-called septal-to-lateral delay, of {$>$}60 ms. Severe dyssynchrony was observed in 27\% of patients with narrow QRS complex, 60\% with intermediate QRS duration, and 70\% with wide QRS complex. No relation existed between QRS duration and septal-to-lateral delay. Conclusion: From 30\% to 40\% of heart failure patients with QRS duration {$>$}120 ms do not exhibit left ventricular dyssynchrony, which may explain the nonresponse to CRT. Alternatively, 27\% of patients with heart failure and a narrow QRS complex show significant left ventricular dyssynchrony and may be candidates for CRT.

  abstract = {Objective The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship of left ventricular (LV) mass and geometry measured with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to incident cardiovascular events in the MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) study. Background MRI is highly accurate for evaluation of heart size and structure and has not previously been used in a large epidemiologic study to predict cardiovascular events. Methods A total of 5,098 participants in the MESA study underwent cardiac MRI at the baseline examination and were followed up for a median of 4 years. Cox proportional hazard models were constructed to predict the end points of coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and heart failure (HF) after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors. Results A total of 216 incident events were observed during the follow-up period. In adjusted models, the end points of incident CHD and stroke were positively associated with increased LV mass-to-volume ratio (CHD, hazard ratio [HR]: 2.1 per g/ml, p = 0.02; stroke, HR: 4.2 per g/ml, p = 0.005). In contrast, LV mass showed the strongest association with incident HF events (HR: 1.4 per 10\% increment, p {$<$} 0.0001). The HF events occurred primarily in participants with LV hypertrophy, that is, {$\geq$}95th percentile of LV mass (HR: 8.6, 95\% confidence interval: 3.7 to 19.9, reference group {$<$}50th percentile of LV mass). Conclusions The LV size was related to incident HF, stroke, and CHD in this multiethnic cohort. Whereas body size-adjusted LV mass alone predicted incident HF, concentric ventricular remodeling predicted incident stroke and CHD.},

Here we introduce a novel extension of the p-value\textemdash a second-generation p-value (p{$\delta$})\textendash that formally accounts for scientific relevance and leverages this natural Type I Error control. The approach relies on a pre-specified interval null hypothesis that represents the collection of effect sizes that are scientifically uninteresting or are practically null. The second-generation p-value is the proportion of data-supported hypotheses that are also null hypotheses. As such, second-generation p-values indicate when the data are compatible with null hypotheses (p{$\delta$} = 1), or with alternative hypotheses (p{$\delta$} = 0), or when the data are inconclusive (0 {$<$} p{$\delta$} {$<$} 1). Moreover, second-generation p-values provide a proper scientific adjustment for multiple comparisons and reduce false discovery rates. This is an advance for environments rich in data, where traditional p-value adjustments are needlessly punitive. Second-generation p-values promote transparency, rigor and reproducibility of scientific results by a priori specifying which candidate hypotheses are practically meaningful and by providing a more reliable statistical summary of when the data are compatible with alternative or null hypotheses.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: QRS morphology on postprocedural ECG indicating posterolateral left ventricular pacing may be predictive of response to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess whether a positive vector in V1 and/or negative vector in lead I on the first postprocedural ECG, suggesting posterolateral capture from CRT, correlates with improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted on all patients who underwent CRT implantation at our institution between April 2008 and December 2011. Biventricular (BiV) paced QRS morphology was defined as R/S {$>$}/=1 in V1 and/or R/S {$<$}/= 1 in lead I. The primary outcome was improvement of LVEF {$>$}/=7.5\%. The chi(2) and t tests were used for analysis. RESULTS: Of 68 patients, 49 (72\%) met our BiV paced QRS morphology criteria. Thirty-four of these 49 patients (69\%) had improvement in LVEF. Of the 19 patients who did not meet our criteria, 17 (89\%) did not have an improvement in LVEF (sensitivity 94\%, specificity 53\%, chi(2) = 19.04, P {$<$} .0001). The average LVEF improvement in patients who met our BiV paced QRS morphology criteria was significantly greater than in those who did not (14.27\% vs 2.63\%, P = .0001). Preprocedural left bundle branch block was not a predictor of echocardiographic response. CONCLUSION: Our results highlight the importance of periprocedural ECG analysis to optimize response to CRT. Moreover, patients without left bundle branch block still benefited from CRT if they met our BiV paced morphology criteria. This suggests that postprocedural left ventricular activation as reflected on the ECG may supersede the baseline conduction delay.},

Methods and results Before and 6.5 {$\pm$} 2.3 months after implantation of a CRT device, longitudinal shortening and stretch were timed and quantified by speckle tracking echocardiography in a cohort of 62 patients. Distinction was made between systolic total stretch (STS; all systolic stretch) and systolic rebound stretch (SRS; only systolic stretch following initial shortening). Systolic total stretch and SRS could be measured in all wall segments in 41 of 62 patients. Septal SRS quantification was possible in all 62 patients and was performed by a blinded observer. Cardiac resynchronization therapy reduced STS (-55 {$\pm$} 30\%) but reduced SRS (-77 {$\pm$} 21\%) significantly more (P {$<$} 0.01). The largest amount of baseline SRS and the largest reductions in SRS (-90 {$\pm$} 22\%) were found in the septum. Reductions in local SRS were paralleled by increases in local systolic shortening that were twice as large (r = 0.79), thereby strongly improving septal function. Baseline values of septal SRS correlated with reductions in left ventricular end-systolic volume index ({$\Delta$}LVESVi; r = 0.62) and brain-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) ({$\Delta$}log10BNP; r = 0.57). Septal SRS was an independent predictor of CRT response in linear regression analysis and predicted {$\Delta$}LVESVi of {$\geq$}15\% with a sensitivity and specificity of 81\% at ROC analysis (areas under the curve 0.89 {$\pm$} 0.04). Conclusion Septal rebound stretch appears to be a sensitive and practical diagnostic criterion to quantify the functional substrate amenable to CRT and to predict response.},

  abstract = {Objectives We studied the acute effects of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) on functional mitral regurgitation in heart failure (HF) patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB). Background Both a decrease in left ventricular (LV) closing force and mitral valve tethering have been implicated as mechanisms for functional mitral regurgitation (FMR) in dilated hearts. We hypothesized that an increase in LV closing force achieved by CRT could act to reduce FMR. Methods Twenty-four HF patients with LBBB and FMR were studied after implantation of a biventricular CRT system. Acute changes in FMR severity between intrinsic conduction (OFF) and CRT were quantified according to the proximal isovelocity surface area method by measuring the effective regurgitant orifice area (EROA). Results were compared with the changes in estimated maximal rate of left ventricular systolic pressure rise (LV+dP/dtmax) and transmitral pressure gradients (TMP), both measured by Doppler echocardiography. Results Cardiac resynchronization therapy was associated with a significant reduction in FMR severity. Effective regurgitant orifice area decreased from 25 {$\pm$} 19 mm2(OFF) to 13 {$\pm$} 8 mm2(CRT). The change in EROA was directly related to the increase in LV+dP/dtmax(r = -0.83, p {$<$} 0.0001). Compared with OFF, TMP increased more rapidly during CRT, and a higher maximal TMP was observed (OFF 73 {$\pm$} 24 mm Hg vs. CRT 85 {$\pm$} 26 mm Hg, p {$<$} 0.01). Conclusions Functional mitral regurgitation is reduced by CRT in patients with HF and LBBB. This effect is directly related to the increased closing force (LV+dP/dtmax). The results support the hypothesis that an increase in TMP, mediated by a rise in LV+dP/dtmaxdue to more coordinated LV contraction, may facilitate effective mitral valve closure.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We sought to assess the effectiveness of automated mechanical dyssynchrony (MD) parameters based on regional heterogeneity of strain (circumferential [CURE], longitudinal [LURE], and radial uniformity ratio estimates) relative to parameters based on regional time to peak contraction with cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) cine DENSE (Displacement Encoding with Stimulated Echoes) validated with myocardial tissue tagging (MTT) strain data. BACKGROUND: Dyssynchrony measures based on the Fourier transformation (FT) of regional strain, such as CURE (previously evaluated in cardiac resynchronization therapy candidates), directly assess MD and yield straightforward global dyssynchrony indexes; however, performance relative to the 12-segment standard deviation of time to peak strain (SD12) or maximal regional delay in time to peak strain is unknown. METHODS: Cine DENSE and MTT were obtained with CMR (1.5-T Siemens Avanto, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) in 13 canines: 3 normal control subjects, 5 with tachycardia pacing-induced heart failure (HF) and left bundle branch ablation (LBBB-HF), and 5 with HF and narrow QRS (NQRS-HF). Strain and dyssynchrony parameters were determined with both CMR methods. RESULTS: Both HF groups had reduced peak strains and left ventricular ejection fraction compared with normal cases. There was strong agreement between cine DENSE and MTT on the basis of intraclass correlation coefficients (CURE: 0.99, 95\% CI: 0.96 to 1.00; LURE: 0.92, 95\% CI: 0.77 to 0.98; circumferential strain [E(CC)]: 0.95, 95\% CI: 0.72 to 0.99; longitudinal strain [E(LL)]: 0.82, 95\% CI: 0.42 to 0.97). The FT-based metrics (scale 0 to 1), in particular CURE, discriminated highly between LBBB-HF and NQRS-HF groups (median difference): CURE: 0.60, 95\% CI: 0.43 to 0.76; LURE: 0.39, 95\% CI: 0.19 to 0.58; radial uniformity ratio estimate: 0.22, 95\% CI: 0.04 to 0.40). In contrast, relative confidence intervals for group differences in time-to-peak parameters were wide, indicating less consistent discrimination (median difference): SD12-E(CC): 52.5, 95\% CI: -4.0 to 109.2; SD12-E(LL): 40.9, 95\% CI: -5.3 to 87.1; SD12-radial strain: 42.0, 95\% CI: 0.4 to 83.6). Correlations between FT-based and time-to-peak parameters were significant (CURE/SD12-E(CC): r = -0.62, p = 0.03; LURE/SD12-E(LL): r = -0.76, p = 0.005) but not as tight as correlations between time-to-peak parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Automated FT-based circumferential, radial, and longitudinal dyssynchrony measures compare favorably with time-to-peak parameters. Cine DENSE was effective for this application and validated with MTT. Further clinical evaluation in cardiac resynchronization therapy candidates with CMR or other imaging modalities is warranted.},

There is a clear philosophy, a sound criterion based in information theory, and a rigorous statistical foundation for AIC. AIC can be justified as Bayesian using a ``savvy'' prior on models that is a function of sample size and the number of model parameters. Furthermore, BIC can be derived as a non-Bayesian result. Therefore, arguments about using AIC versus BIC for model selection cannot be from a Bayes versus frequentist perspective. The philosophical context of what is assumed about reality, approximating models, and the intent of model-based inference should determine whether AIC or BIC is used. Various facets of such multimodel inference are presented here, particularly methods of model averaging.},

Whereas multiple national, international, and trial registries for heart failure have been created, international standards for clinical assessment and outcome measurement do not currently exist. The working group's objective was to facilitate international comparison in heart failure care, using standardized parameters and meaningful patient-centered outcomes for research and quality of care assessments. The International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement recruited an international working group of clinical heart failure experts, researchers, and patient representatives to define a standard set of outcomes and risk-adjustment variables. This was designed to document, compare, and ultimately improve patient care outcomes in the heart failure population, with a focus on global feasibility and relevance. The working group employed a Delphi process, patient focus groups, online patient surveys, and multiple systematic publications searches. The process occurred over 10 months, employing 7 international teleconferences. A 17-item set has been established, addressing selected functional, psychosocial, burden of care, and survival outcome domains. These measures were designed to include all patients with heart failure, whether entered at first presentation or subsequent decompensation, excluding cardiogenic shock. Sources include clinician report, administrative data, and validated patient-reported outcome measurement tools: the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire; the Patient Health Questionnaire-2; and the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System. Recommended data included those to support risk adjustment and benchmarking across providers and regions. The International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement developed a dataset designed to capture, compare, and improve care for heart failure, with feasibility and relevance for patients and clinicians worldwide.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We compared mechanical dyssynchrony and the impact of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) in failing hearts with a pure right (RBBB) versus left bundle branch block (LBBB). BACKGROUND: Cardiac resynchronization therapy is effective for treating failing hearts with conduction delay and discoordinate contraction. Most data pertain to LBBB delays. With RBBB, the lateral wall contracts early so that biventricular (BiV) pre-excitation may not be needed. Furthermore, the magnitude of dyssynchrony and impact of CRT in pure RBBB versus LBBB remains largely unknown. METHODS: Dogs with tachypacing-induced heart failure combined with right or left bundle branch radiofrequency ablation were studied. Basal dyssynchrony and effects of single and BiV CRT on left ventricular (LV) function were assessed by pressure-volume catheter and tagged magnetic resonance imaging, respectively. RESULTS: Left bundle branch block and RBBB induced similar QRS widening, and LV function (ejection fraction, maximum time derivative of LV pressure [dP/dt(max)]) was similarly depressed in failing hearts with both conduction delays. Despite this, mechanical dyssynchrony was less in RBBB (circumferential uniformity ratio estimate [CURE] index: 0.80 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.58 +/- 0.09 for LBBB, p {$<$} 0.04; CURE 0--{$>$}1 is dyssynchronous--{$>$}synchronous). Cardiac resynchronization therapy had correspondingly less effect on hearts with RBBB than those with LBBB (i.e., 5.5 +/- 1.1\% vs. 29.5 +/- 5.0\% increase in dP/dt(max), p {$<$} 0.005), despite similar baselines. Furthermore, right ventricular-only pacing enhanced function and synchrony in RBBB as well or better than did BiV, whereas LV-only pacing worsened function. CONCLUSIONS: Less mechanical dyssynchrony is induced by RBBB than LBBB in failing hearts, and the corresponding impact of CRT on the former is reduced. Right ventricular-only pacing may be equally efficacious as BiV CRT in hearts with pure right bundle branch conduction delay.},

To account for factors that might influence the test accuracy, various ROC regression methods have been proposed. However, as in any regression analysis, when the assumed models do not fit the data well, these methods may render invalid and misleading results. To date, practical model-checking techniques suitable for validating existing ROC regression models are not yet available. In this article, we develop cumulative residual-based procedures to graphically and numerically assess the goodness of fit for some commonly used ROC regression models, and show how specific components of these models can be examined within this framework. We derive asymptotic null distributions for the residual processes and discuss resampling procedures to approximate these distributions in practice. We illustrate our methods with a dataset from the cystic fibrosis registry.},

As a considerable number of patients do not respond adequately to CRT, echocardiographic dyssynchrony selection criteria have been proposed to improve CRT response, but these parameters eventually failed to provide superior selection of CRT candidates. In the last decade, an echo-dyssynchrony parameter called ``septal flash'' was been reported by several investigators and opinion leaders in the field of CRT. This parameter has a strong pathophysiological rationale and was shown to be a robust and predominant predictor of CRT response in recent observational and retrospective studies. We here provide a comprehensive and balanced overview of septal flash and address several important aspects, questions and potential future implications of septal flash in cardiomyopathy and CRT.},

Although this modeling problem has been extensively studied, it remains unclear how to effectively control the fraction of false discoveries even in high-dimensional logistic regression, not to mention general highdimensional nonlinear models. To address such a practical problem, we propose a new framework of model-X knockoffs, which reads from a different perspective the knockoff procedure (Barber and Cand`es, 2015) originally designed for controlling the false discovery rate in linear models. Whereas the knockoffs procedure is constrained to homoscedastic linear models with n {$\geq$} p, the key innovation here is that model-X knockoffs provide valid inference from finite samples in settings in which the conditional distribution of the response is arbitrary and completely unknown. Furthermore, this holds no matter the number of covariates. Correct inference in such a broad setting is achieved by constructing knockoff variables probabilistically instead of geometrically. To do this, our approach requires the covariates be random (independent and identically distributed rows) with a distribution that is known, although we provide preliminary experimental evidence that our procedure is robust to unknown/estimated distributions. To our knowledge, no other procedure solves the controlled variable selection problem in such generality, but in the restricted settings where competitors exist, we demonstrate the superior power of knockoffs through simulations. Finally, we apply our procedure to data from a case-control study of Crohn's disease in the United Kingdom, making twice as many discoveries as the original analysis of the same data.},

  abstract = {Model selection strategies for machine learning algorithms typically involve the numerical optimisation of an appropriate model selection criterion, often based on an estimator of generalisation performance, such as k-fold cross-validation. The error of such an estimator can be broken down into bias and variance components. While unbiasedness is often cited as a beneficial quality of a model selection criterion, we demonstrate that a low variance is at least as important, as a nonnegligible variance introduces the potential for over-fitting in model selection as well as in training the model. While this observation is in hindsight perhaps rather obvious, the degradation in performance due to over-fitting the model selection criterion can be surprisingly large, an observation that appears to have received little attention in the machine learning literature to date. In this paper, we show that the effects of this form of over-fitting are often of comparable magnitude to differences in performance between learning algorithms, and thus cannot be ignored in empirical evaluation. Furthermore, we show that some common performance evaluation practices are susceptible to a form of selection bias as a result of this form of over-fitting and hence are unreliable. We discuss methods to avoid over-fitting in model selection and subsequent selection bias in performance evaluation, which we hope will be incorporated into best practice. While this study concentrates on cross-validation based model selection, the findings are quite general and apply to any model selection practice involving the optimisation of a model selection criterion evaluated over a finite sample of data, including maximisation of the Bayesian evidence and optimisation of performance bounds.},

Fortunately the leave-one-out cross-validation procedure can be performed or a least approximated very efficiently in closed form for a wide variety of kernel learning methods, providing a convenient means for model selection. Leave-one-out cross-validation based estimates of performance, however, generally exhibit a relatively high variance and are therefore prone to over-fitting. In this paper, we investigate the novel use of Bayesian regularisation at the second level of inference, adding a regularisation term to the model selection criterion corresponding to a prior over the hyper-parameter values, where the additional regularisation parameters are integrated out analytically. Results obtained on a suite of thirteen real-world and synthetic benchmark data sets clearly demonstrate the benefit of this approach.},

  abstract = {Objective Mechanical evaluation of dyssynchrony by echocardiography has not replaced ECG in routine cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT) evaluation because of its complexity and lack of reproducibility. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential correlations between electromechanical parameters (atrioventricular, interventricular and intraventricular from the dyssynchrony model presented in 2000), their ability to describe dyssynchrony and their potential use in resynchrony. Methods 455 sets of the 18 parameters of the model obtained in 91 patients submitted to various pacing configurations were evaluated two by two using a Pearson correlation test and then by groups according to their ability to describe dyssynchrony, using the Column selection method of machine learning. Results The best parameter is duration of septal contraction, which alone describes 25\% of dyssynchrony. The best groups of 3, 4 and {$\geq$}8 variables describe 59\%, 73\% and almost 100\% of dyssynchrony, respectively. Left pre-ejection interval is highly and significantly correlated to a maximum of other variables, and its decrease is associated with the favourable evolution of all other correlated parameters. Increase in filling duration and decrease in duration of septum to lateral wall contraction difference are not associated with the favourable evolution of other parameters. Conclusions No single electromechanical parameter alone can fully describe dyssynchrony. The 18-parameter model can be simplified, but still requires at least 4\textendash 8 parameters. Decrease in left pre-ejection interval favourably drives resynchrony in a maximum of other parameters. Increase in filling duration and decrease in septum\textendash lateral wall difference do not appear to be good CRT targets.},

This condition may be difficult to meet even in a well-designed study when the number of potential confounders is large, the outcome is rare, and/or interactions are of interest. Various propensity score approaches have been implemented when the exposure is binary. Recent work on shrinkage approaches like lasso were motivated by the critical need to develop methods for the p {$>>$} n situation, where p is the number of parameters and n is the sample size. Those methods, however, have been less frequently used when p{$\approx$}n, and in this situation, there is no guidance on choosing among regular logistic regression models, propensity score methods, and shrinkage approaches. To fill this gap, we conducted extensive simulations mimicking our motivating clinical data, estimating vaccine effectiveness for preventing influenza hospitalizations in the 2011\textendash 2012 influenza season. Ridge regression and penalized logistic regression models that penalize all but the coefficient of the exposure may be considered in these types of studies.

  abstract = {Aims We tested the hypothesis that a machine learning (ML) algorithm utilizing both complex echocardiographic data and clinical parameters could be used to phenogroup a heart failure (HF) cohort and identify patients with beneficial response to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). Methods and results We studied 1106 HF patients from the Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial with Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (MADIT-CRT) (left ventricular ejection fraction {$\leq$} 30\%, QRS {$\geq$} 130 ms, New York Heart Association class {$\leq$} II) randomized to CRT with a defibrillator (CRT-D, n = 677) or an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD, n = 429). An unsupervised ML algorithm (Multiple Kernel Learning and K-means clustering) was used to categorize subjects by similarities in clinical parameters, and left ventricular volume and deformation traces at baseline into mutually exclusive groups. The treatment effect of CRT-D on the primary outcome (all-cause death or HF event) and on volume response was compared among these groups. Our analysis identified four phenogroups, significantly different in the majority of baseline clinical characteristics, biomarker values, measures of left and right ventricular structure and function and the primary outcome occurrence. Two phenogroups included a higher proportion of known clinical characteristics predictive of CRT response, and were associated with a substantially better treatment effect of CRT-D on the primary outcome [hazard ratio (HR) 0.35; 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.19\textendash 0.64; P = 0.0005 and HR 0.36; 95\% CI 0.19\textendash 0.68; P = 0.001] than observed in the other groups (interaction P = 0.02). Conclusions Our results serve as a proof-of-concept that, by integrating clinical parameters and full heart cycle imaging data, unsupervised ML can provide a clinically meaningful classification of a phenotypically heterogeneous HF cohort and might aid in optimizing the rate of responders to specific therapies.},

The conventional ST-Change Vector Magnitude (STCVM) and Spatial Ventricular Gradient (SVG) were also calculated. Results indicate that the most of them show significant differences between healthy and ischemic subjects. Since, the statistical minute-byminute PTCA comparison against a healthy population shows that ischemic patients monitoring reached values of Sensitivity = 99.5\% and Specificity = 99.4\%, when STVD, TVD and SVG were used in the classification. In conclusion the sensitivity and specificity for acute ischemia monitoring could be increase with the used of only three vectorcardiographic parameters.},

We sought to define the potential benefit of CRT in these patients through meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that have reported outcomes in patients with non-LBBB QRS morphology. Methods We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for RCTs of CRT that reported outcomes according to QRS morphology. We performed meta-analysis of these RCTs to assess the effect of CRT on the end points of death, HF hospitalisation, and the composite of death and HF hospitalisation. Results Five RCTs were analysed, including 6523 participants (1766 with non-LBBB QRS morphology). CRT was not associated with a reduction in death and/or HF hospitalisation in subjects with non-LBBB QRS morphology (HR 0.99 95\% CI 0.82 to 1.20). Conclusions CRT is not associated with a reduction in death or HF hospitalisation in patients with non-LBBB QRS morphology. Wide QRS with non-LBBB morphology remains an area of uncertainty for CRT, which is included in the recent European Society of Cardiology guidelines with a weaker strength of recommendation, but is not supported by a dedicated RCT.},

Methods and results The BIOSTAT-CHF index cohort included 2516 patients with new or worsening HF symptoms: 1694 enrolled as inpatients (acute HF) and 822 as outpatients (worsening HF in chronic outpatients). A validation cohort included 935 inpatients and 803 outpatients. Multivariable models were developed in the index cohort using clinical characteristics, routine laboratory values, and proteomics data to examine which factors predict adverse outcomes in both conditions and to determine which factors differ between acute HF and worsening HF in chronic outpatients, validated in the validation cohort. Patients with acute HF had substantially higher morbidity and mortality (6-month mortality was 12.3\% for acute HF and 4.7\% for worsening HF in chronic outpatients). Multivariable models predicting 180-day mortality and 180-day HF readmission differed substantially between acute HF and worsening HF in chronic outpatients. Carbohydrate antigen 125 was the strongest single biomarker to distinguish acute HF from worsening HF in chronic outpatients, but only yielded a C-index of 0.71. A model including multiple biomarkers and clinical variables achieved a high degree of discrimination with a C-index of 0.913 in the index cohort and 0.901 in the validation cohort. Conclusions This study identifies different characteristics and predictors of outcome in acute HF patients as compared to outpatients with chronic HF developing worsening HF. The markers identified may be useful in better diagnosing acute HF and may become targets for treatment development.},

Although the severity of clinical features in male patients is well described, only recently have studies reported the high prevalence of disabling clinical features in heterozygous females. Aims: This study sets out to examine the clinical features and natural history of Fabry disease in further detail in a large group of female patients. Methods: Data were obtained from 303 females enrolled in the Fabry Outcome Survey. Pain was assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory, and health related quality of life (HRQoL) was assessed using the European Quality of Life Questionnaire. A modified version of the Mainz Severity Score Index was also applied. Data on left ventricular mass (LVM) index, mean ventricular wall thickness, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were used to assess cardiac and renal involvement. Results: The most commonly reported clinical features in females were neurological (77\%) and cardiac (59\%). A history of renal involvement was recorded in 40\% of cases. Neurological features were the earliest to develop (mean age: 16 years), whereas cardiac (mean age: 33.5 years) and renal (mean age: 37.3 years) features developed later. LVM index increased exponentially with age. In addition, age was negatively correlated with estimated GFR and HRQoL. Conclusions: Females with Fabry disease report important age related clinical features and clinical investigation demonstrates evidence of disease progression. This study highlights the importance of careful and longitudinal assessment of female heterozygote patients with Fabry disease.},

  abstract = {BackgroundCurrent guidelines select patients for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) mainly on electrocardiographic parameters like QRS duration and left bundle branch block (LBBB). However, among those LBBB patients, heterogeneity in mechanical dyssynchrony occurs and might be a reason for nonresponse to CRT. This study assesses the relation between electrocardiographic characteristics and presence of mechanical dyssynchrony among LBBB patients. MethodsThe study included patients with true LBBB (including mid-QRS notching) on standard 12-lead electrocardiograms. Left bundle branch block-induced mechanical dyssynchrony was assessed by the presence of septal flash on two-dimensional echocardiography. Previously reported electro- and vectorcardiographic dyssynchrony markers were analyzed: global QRS duration (QRSD(LBBB)), left ventricular activation time (QRSD(LVAT)), time to intrinsicoid deflection (QRSD(ID)), and vectorcardiographic QRS areas in the 3D vector loop (QRSA(3D)). ResultsThe study enrolled 545 LBBB patients. Septal flash (SF) is present in 52\% of patients presenting with true LBBB. Patients with SF are more frequent female, have less ischemic heart disease and smaller left ventricular dimensions. In multivariate analysis longer QRSD(LBBB), QRSD(LVAT) and larger QRSA(3D) were independently associated with SF. Of all parameters, QRSA(3D) has the best accuracy to predict SF, although overall accuracy remains moderate (59\% sensitivity, 58\% specificity). The predictive value of QRSA(3D) remained constant in both sexes, irrespective of ischemic heart disease, ejection fraction and even when categorizing for QRSD(LBBB). ConclusionIn LBBB patients, large QRS areas correlate better with mechanical dyssynchrony compared to wide QRSD intervals. However, the overall accuracy to predict mechanical dyssynchrony by electrocardiographic dyssynchrony markers, even when using complex vectorcardiographic parameters, remains low.},

We sought to compare left ventricular (LV) activation patterns in heart failure patients with narrow QRS and NICD to patients with LBBB using high-density electroanatomic activation maps.Methods and Results\textemdash Fifty-two heart failure patients (narrow QRS [n=18], LBBB [n=11], NICD [n=23]) underwent 3-dimensional electroanatomic mapping with a high density of mapping points (387{$\pm$}349 LV). Adjunctive scar imaging was available in 37 (71\%) patients and was analyzed in relation to activation maps. LBBB patients typically demonstrated (1) a single LV breakthrough at the septum (38{$\pm$}15 ms post-QRS onset); (2) prolonged right-to-left transseptal activation with absence of direct LV Purkinje activity; (3) homogeneous propagation within the LV cavity; and (4) latest activation at the basal lateral LV. In comparison, both NICD and narrow QRS patients demonstrated (1) multiple LV breakthroughs along the posterior or anterior fascicles: narrow QRS versus LBBB, 5{$\pm$}2 versus 1{$\pm$}1; P=0.0004; NICD versus LBBB, 4{$\pm$}2 versus 1{$\pm$}1; P=0.001); (2) evidence of early/pre-QRS LV electrograms with Purkinje potentials; (3) rapid propagation in narrow QRS patients and more heterogeneous propagation in NICD patients; and (4) presence of limited areas of late activation associated with LV scar with high interindividual heterogeneity.Conclusions\textemdash In contrast to LBBB patients, narrow QRS and NICD patients are characterized by distinct mechanisms of LV activation, which may predict poor response to cardiac resynchronization therapy.},

It is recognized that different feature selection techniques may result in different set of biomarkers, that is, different groups of genes highly correlated to a given pathological condition, but few direct comparisons exist which quantify these differences in a systematic way. In this paper, we propose a general methodology for comparing the outcomes of different selection techniques in the context of biomarker discovery. The comparison is carried out along two dimensions: (i) measuring the similarity/dissimilarity of selected gene sets; (ii) evaluating the implications of these differences in terms of both predictive performance and stability of selected gene sets. As a case study, we considered three benchmarks deriving from DNA microarray experiments and conducted a comparative analysis among eight selection methods, representatives of different classes of feature selection techniques. Our results show that the proposed approach can provide useful insight about the pattern of agreement of biomarker discovery techniques.},

Segmental longitudinal, circumferential, and radial strains were assessed with 4 different software. The inter-vendor difference as well as intra- and inter-observer variability was investigated. Furthermore, the accuracy of CMR-FT for the detection of structural (infarcted segments) as well as functional pathology (septal vs. lateral wall strain in left bundle branch block) was tested.ResultsBetween vendors, there were significant differences in values for all strains (p {$<$} 0.001). The software using a non-rigid algorithm for image registration and segmentation demonstrated the best intra- as well as inter-observer variability with interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) {$>$} 0.962 and coefficient of variation (CV) {$<$} 24\%. For infarct location, the same software yielded the highest area under the curve values for radial and circumferential SS (0.872 and 0.859, respectively). One of the other three software using optical flow technology performed best for longitudinal SS (0.799) and showed the largest differences in SS between septum and lateral wall in the dilated cardiomyopathy group.ConclusionSS values obtained by CMR-FT are not interchangeable between vendors, and intra- and inter-observer reproducibility shows substantial variability among vendors. Overall, the different packages score relatively well to depict focal structural or functional LV pathology.Key Points\textbullet{} Segmental myocardial strain values obtained by CMR feature tracking are not interchangeable between different vendors.\textbullet{} Intra- and inter-observer reproducibility shows substantial variability among vendors.\textbullet{} Segmental myocardial strains measured by CMR feature tracking score relatively well to depict focal structural or functional LV pathology.},

We conducted an acute and chronic study, evaluating the response of heart failure patients with a narrow QRS to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). ESTEEM-CRT was a multi-center, single-arm, feasibility study that evaluated ICD-indicated, medically-optimized patients with EF {$\leq$} 35\%, NYHA class III heart failure, QRS duration {$<$}120 ms, and MD as defined by the standard deviation of time to peak systolic velocity of 12 segments (Ts-SD). Sixty-eight patients received a CRT defibrillator, exercise testing, and echo exams, and 47 of these patients underwent invasive hemodynamic testing at implant. Follow-up was at 6 and 12 months. The average maximal improvement in LV dP/dtmax was minor (2 {$\pm$} 2\%). NYHA and quality of life scores were substantially improved at 6 and 12 months (P {$<$} 0.001), while exercise capacity and LV volumes were unchanged. The echo indices of MD were difficult to collect, discordant, and failed to predict clinical outcomes. ESTEEM-CRT patients with a narrow QRS and MD as defined in this study did not improve as measured by acute hemodynamics, chronic exercise performance, or reverse remodeling. These multi-center results support the notion that dyssynchrony indices are ineffective or at least require greater refinement for the selection of narrow QRS patients for CRT.},

We aim to explore if combing the value of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) and echocardiography could be beneficial for selecting heart failure patients for CRT in terms of improvement in long-term survival, clinical symptoms, LV function, and volumes. Speckle tracking echocardiography will be used to assess LV dyssynchrony and wasted cardiac work whereas myocardial scar will be assessed with late gadolinium contrast enhanced CMR.

  abstract = {Introduction Cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT) was initially developed to treat patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB). However, many patients with heart failure have a widened QRS but neither left-BBB nor right-BBB; this is called non-specific intraventricular conduction delay (NICD). It is unclear whether CRT is effective in this subgroup of patients. Methods and analysis The NICD-CRT study is a prospective, double-blind, randomised (1:1), parallel-arm, multicentre trial comparing the effects of CRT in patients with heart failure, a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF {$<$}35\%) and NICD, who have been implanted with a device (CRT-pacemaker or CRT-defibrillator) that has or has not been activated. Enrolment began on 15 July 2015 and should finish within 3 years; 40 patients have already been randomised and 11 centres have agreed to participate. The primary end point is the comparison of the proportion of patients improved, unchanged or worsened over the subsequent 12 months. 100 patients per group are required to demonstrate a difference between groups with a statistical power of 90\%, a type I error of 0.05\% (two-sided) and a loss to follow-up of 10\%. This trial will add substantially to the modest amount of existing data on CRT in patients with NICD and should reduce uncertainty for guidelines and clinical practice when added to the pool of current information. Ethics and dissemination Local ethics committee authorisations have been obtained since May 2015. We will publish findings from this study in a peer-reviewed scientific journal and present results at national and international conferences. Trial registration number NCT02454439; pre-results.},

Because LA function cannot be assessed from cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using the well-established left ventricular tagging techniques, we hypothesized that adequate feature tracking (FT) applied to conventional cine MRI data could characterize LA function accurately. Methods We studied 10 young (28 {$\pm$} 7 years) and 10 elderly (64 {$\pm$} 6 years) healthy subjects, as well as 20 patients with moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis (AVS; 73 {$\pm$} 15 years, effective aortic valve area: 0.67 {$\pm$} 0.36 cm2). MRI cine two-, three-, and four-chamber views were analyzed using a newly proposed FT method based on spatial correlation and endocardial detection resulting in: regional and global longitudinal strain and strain rate, radial motion fraction and relative velocity for the three LA motion phases including reservoir, conduit, and LA contraction. Results FT reliability was indicated by a good overlap between tracking results and manual LA endocardial borders, the low error for comparison against theoretical strains introduced in a synthetic phantom and the good inter-observer reproducibility (coefficient of variation {$<$} 15\%). While all LA functional parameters were significantly impaired in AVS patients (p {$<$} 0.04), subclinical age-related variations induced a decreasing trend on all LA parameters but were significant only for radial conduit function parameters (p {$<$} 0.03). Finally, LA functional parameters characterized LA alteration in AVS with higher sensitivity than conventional LA volumetric parameters. Conclusions Left atrial FT is feasible on MRI cine images and its addition to conventional analysis tools might enhance the diagnosis value of MRI in many heart diseases. J. Magn. Reson.

We aimed to assess the repeatability and to determine the influence of T-end position on PCA parameters. METHODS: Digital ECGs recorded from 30 subjects were used to assess short term (5 minutes), circadian and long-term (28 days) repeatability of PCA parameters. The T-end cursor position was moved backward and forward (+/- 8 ms) from its optimal position. We calculated QRS-T angle, PCA ratio, and T-wave residuum (TWR). RESULTS: At long-term evaluation, coefficients of variation were 11.3 +/- 9.9\%, 11.7 +/- 7.1\%, and 23.0 +/- 22.0\% for the QRS-T angle, PCA ratio, TWR, respectively. After moving the T-end cursor, repeatability was 0.42 +/- 0.2\%, 1.00 +/- 1.04\%, 4.0 +/- 4.2\% for the same PCA parameters. CONCLUSIONS: T-wave morphology parameters based on PCA are reproducible with the exception of TWR and QRS-T angle. In addition, PCA is robust, showing only little dependence on T-end cursor position. These data should be taken into account for safety pharmacology trials.},

While the former is enjoyed to some extent by many existing forecasting approaches, the latter in the sense of controlling the fraction of wrongly discovered features which can enhance greatly the interpretability is still largely underdeveloped. To this end, in this paper we exploit the general framework of model-X knockoffs introduced recently in Cand\`es, Fan, Janson and Lv (2018), which is nonconventional for reproducible large-scale inference in that the framework is completely free of the use of p-values for significance testing, and suggest a new method of intertwined probabilistic factors decoupling (IPAD) for stable interpretable forecasting with knockoffs inference in high-dimensional models. The recipe of the method is constructing the knockoff variables by assuming a latent factor model that is exploited widely in economics and finance for the association structure of covariates. Our method and work are distinct from the existing literature in that we estimate the covariate distribution from data instead of assuming that it is known when constructing the knockoff variables, our procedure does not require any sample splitting, we provide theoretical justifications on the asymptotic false discovery rate control, and the theory for the power analysis is also established. Several simulation examples and the real data analysis further demonstrate that the newly suggested method has appealing finite-sample performance with desired interpretability and stability compared to some popularly used forecasting methods.},

Variable selection plays a pivotal role in contemporary statistical learning and scientific discoveries. The traditional idea of best subset selection methods, which can be regarded as a specific form of penalized likelihood, is computationally too expensive for many modern statistical applications. Other forms of penalized likelihood methods have been successfully developed over the last decade to cope with high dimensionality. They have been widely applied for simultaneously selecting important variables and estimating their effects in high dimensional statistical inference. In this article, we present a brief account of the recent developments of theory, methods, and implementations for high dimensional variable selection. What limits of the dimensionality such methods can handle, what the role of penalty functions is, and what the statistical properties are rapidly drive the advances of the field. The properties of non-concave penalized likelihood and its roles in high dimensional statistical modeling are emphasized. We also review some recent advances in ultra-high dimensional variable selection, with emphasis on independence screening and two-scale methods.},

  abstract = {Background:Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) has significant nonresponse rates. We assessed whether machine learning (ML) could predict CRT response beyond current guidelines.Methods:We analyzed CRT patients from Cleveland Clinic and Johns Hopkins. A training cohort was created from all Johns Hopkins patients and an equal number of randomly sampled Cleveland Clinic patients. All remaining patients comprised the testing cohort. Response was defined as {$\geq$}10\% increase in left ventricular ejection fraction. ML models were developed to predict CRT response using different combinations of classification algorithms and clinical variable sets on the training cohort. The model with the highest area under the curve was evaluated on the testing cohort. Probability of response was used to predict survival free from a composite end point of death, heart transplant, or placement of left ventricular assist device. Predictions were compared with current guidelines.Results:Nine hundred twenty-five patients were included. On the training cohort (n=470: 235, Johns Hopkins; 235, Cleveland Clinic), the best ML model was a naive Bayes classifier including 9 variables (QRS morphology, QRS duration, New York Heart Association classification, left ventricular ejection fraction and end-diastolic diameter, sex, ischemic cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, and epicardial left ventricular lead). On the testing cohort (n=455, Cleveland Clinic), ML demonstrated better response prediction than guidelines (area under the curve, 0.70 versus 0.65; P=0.012) and greater discrimination of event-free survival (concordance index, 0.61 versus 0.56; P{$<$}0.001). The fourth quartile of the ML model had the greatest risk of reaching the composite end point, whereas the first quartile had the least (hazard ratio, 0.34; P{$<$}0.001).Conclusions:ML with 9 variables incrementally improved prediction of echocardiographic CRT response and survival beyond guidelines. Performance was not improved by incorporating more variables. The model offers potential for improved shared decision-making in CRT (online calculator: http://riskcalc.org:3838/CRTResponseScore). Significant remaining limitations confirm the need to identify better variables to predict CRT response.},

Further, the model does not have some of the properties of the fixed-covariate model; it cannot usually be used to predict the survival (time-to-event) curve over time.

If left bundle-branch block (LBBB) is associated with left ventricular dyssynchrony and impaired cardiac performance in HFpEF, cardiac resynchronization therapy could be a promising treatment. Methods We performed a cross-sectional analysis of selected patients with HFpEF (ejection fraction {$\geq$}50\%) with and without LBBB (normal conduction, NC) and patients with HFrEF and LBBB who were suitable cardiac resynchronization therapy candidates to describe and contextualize the mechanical phenotype of LBBB in HFpEF. Systolic and diastolic isovolumic times, ejection time(ET), and diastolic filling time(DFT) were measured on spectral tissue Doppler echocardiographic images and indexed to the heart rate. Dyssynchrony pattern was assessed using speckle-tracked longitudinal strain patterns. Comparisons were performed using analysis of variance and {$\chi$}2 test with posthoc pairwise comparisons as indicated. Results Eighty-two HFpEF (50 with NC, 32 with LBBB) and 149 HFrEF (all with LBBB) patients met criteria. Overall, 84.4\% with HFpEF/LBBB and 91.3\% with HFrEF/LBBB had demonstrable mechanical dyssynchrony compared to 0\% with HFpEF/NC. Compared to HFpEF/NC, HFpEF/LBBB had significantly prolonged isovolumetric contraction time (ICT), isovolumetric relaxation time (IRT), and total isovolumetric time and significantly shorter ET (all indexed). LBBB/HFrEF patients, compared to LBBB/HFpEF patients, had increased ICT and IRT with decreased DFT but similar ET. Conclusions Patients with HFpEF and LBBB frequently have an LBBB dyssynchrony phenotype, prolonged ICT and IRT, and reduced ET compared to HFpEF patients with NC. The electromechanical dyssynchrony and disordered cardiac timing of HFpEF with LBBB are similar to HFrEF with LBBB.},

Methods We inserted electrode catheters into the coronary sinus (CS) and venous branches of the CS during CRT implantations and constructed electroanatomical contact maps in 16 patients using the EnSite NavX\texttrademark{} system. Mechanical activation was evaluated by speckle-tracking echocardiography and the latest mechanical and electrical sites were compared. The degrees of the electrical and mechanical delays of the implanted LV lead were also compared. Results The electroanatomical maps revealed that the latest electrical sites were anterior in one, anterolateral in five, lateral in eight, and posterolateral in two. Echocardiographic imaging revealed that the latest mechanical sites were anteroseptal in two, anterior in four, lateral in five, posterior in two, and inferior in three. The latest electrical and mechanical sites matched in only three patients. The degree of the local mechanical delay for the LV lead was significantly larger in the responders than nonresponders, whereas the local electrical delay did not differ.

Strain evaluates myocardial deformation while strain rate examines the rate of change in strain. This review will focus on the various types of strain analysis for evaluation of LA function, alterations in LA strain in physiological and pathologic states that alter LA function and finally evaluate its utility as a prognostic marker.},

  abstract = {A substantial proportion of patients with acute myocardial infarction develop clinical heart failure, which remains a common and major healthcare burden. It has been shown that in patients with chronic coronary artery disease, ischemic episodes lead to a global pattern of cardiomyocyte remodeling and dedifferentiation, hallmarked by myolysis, glycogen accumulation, and alteration of structural proteins. These changes, in conjunction with an impaired global coronary reserve, may eventually become irreversible and result in ischemic cardiomyopathy. Moreover, noninvasive imaging of myocardial scar and hibernation can inform the risk of sudden cardiac death. Therefore, it would be intuitive that imaging of myocardial viability is an essential tool for the proper use of invasive treatment strategies and patient prognostication. However, this notion has been challenged by large-scale clinical trials demonstrating that, in the modern era of improved guideline-directed medical therapies, imaging of myocardial viability failed to deliver effective guidance of coronary bypass surgery to a reduction of adverse cardiac outcomes. In addition, current available imaging technologies in this regard are numerous, and they target diverse surrogates of structural or tissue substrates of myocardial viability. In this document, we examine these issues in the current clinical context, collect current evidence of imaging technology by modality, and inform future directions.},

Voxel feature tracking (FT) is a novel technique for the assessment of LA function. We aimed to investigate if voxel FT derived longitudinal or radial strains are superior to traditionally derived parameters of LA function (LA SV and LA EF) in predicting LV function. Methods Twelve-patients underwent CMR at 3T (Achieva CV, Philips Healthcare, Best, The Netherlands) within 3 days following AMI. CMR protocol included: cines and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) imaging (0.1 mmol/kg gadolinium DTPA). Indexed LAEDV (LAEDVi), end-systolic volume (LAESVi) and ejection fraction were computed by bi-plane method. Voxel FT for the LA in the long axis 4-chamber cines was analysed offline using commercially available software (cvi42 v5.1, Circle Cardiovascular Imaging Inc., Calgary, Canada). Results Demographics and basic CMR parameters are mentioned in Table 1. Analysis time was longer for manual contouring and computation of LA EF and SV compared to 4-CH strain analysis (4 {$\pm$} 2 min versus 2 {$\pm$} 1.5 min, p = 0.01). On univariate analysis, LV EF was correlated to peak longitudinal strain (PLS) (p = 0.01) and peak radial strain (PRS) (p = 0.02). On multivariate regression analysis, PLS of LA was most strongly correlated to LV EF (R=0.68; p = 0.015). All other parameters did not achieve statistical significance. Conclusion Peak left atrial longitudinal strain (PLS) is the only parameter of LA function, which independently correlates to LV ejection fraction. PLS of the LA is easily assessed on 4-chamber cines alone and takes less time to compute than the manually generated parameters of LA function.

  abstract = {Fabry disease (FD) is a progressive, X-linked inherited disorder of glycosphingolipid metabolism due to deficient or absent lysosomal {$\alpha$}-galactosidase A activity. FD is pan-ethnic and the reported annual incidence of 1 in 100,000 may underestimate the true prevalence of the disease. Classically affected hemizygous males, with no residual {$\alpha$}-galactosidase A activity may display all the characteristic neurological (pain), cutaneous (angiokeratoma), renal (proteinuria, kidney failure), cardiovascular (cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia), cochleo-vestibular and cerebrovascular (transient ischemic attacks, strokes) signs of the disease while heterozygous females have symptoms ranging from very mild to severe. Deficient activity of lysosomal {$\alpha$}-galactosidase A results in progressive accumulation of globotriaosylceramide within lysosomes, believed to trigger a cascade of cellular events. Demonstration of marked {$\alpha$}-galactosidase A deficiency is the definitive method for the diagnosis of hemizygous males. Enzyme analysis may occasionnally help to detect heterozygotes but is often inconclusive due to random X-chromosomal inactivation so that molecular testing (genotyping) of females is mandatory. In childhood, other possible causes of pain such as rheumatoid arthritis and 'growing pains' must be ruled out. In adulthood, multiple sclerosis is sometimes considered. Prenatal diagnosis, available by determination of enzyme activity or DNA testing in chorionic villi or cultured amniotic cells is, for ethical reasons, only considered in male fetuses. Pre-implantation diagnosis is possible. The existence of atypical variants and the availability of a specific therapy singularly complicate genetic counseling. A disease-specific therapeutic option - enzyme replacement therapy using recombinant human {$\alpha$}-galactosidase A - has been recently introduced and its long term outcome is currently still being investigated. Conventional management consists of pain relief with analgesic drugs, nephroprotection (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptors blockers) and antiarrhythmic agents, whereas dialysis or renal transplantation are available for patients experiencing end-stage renal failure. With age, progressive damage to vital organ systems develops and at some point, organs may start to fail in functioning. End-stage renal disease and life-threatening cardiovascular or cerebrovascular complications limit life-expectancy of untreated males and females with reductions of 20 and 10 years, respectively, as compared to the general population. While there is increasing evidence that long-term enzyme therapy can halt disease progression, the importance of adjunctive therapies should be emphasized and the possibility of developing an oral therapy drives research forward into active site specific chaperones.},

We assessed the 10-year outcome of recombinant {$\alpha$}-galactosidase A therapy. Methods The outcomes (severe clinical events, renal function, cardiac structure) of 52/58 patients with classic Fabry disease from the phase 3 clinical trial and extension study, and the Fabry Registry were evaluated. Disease progression rates for patients with low renal involvement (LRI, n=32) or high renal involvement (HRI, n=20) at baseline were assessed. Results 81\% of patients (42/52) did not experience any severe clinical event during the treatment interval and 94\% (49/52) were alive at the end of the study period. Ten patients reported a total of 16 events. Patients classified as LRI started therapy 13 years younger than HRI (mean 25 years vs 38 years). Mean slopes for estimated glomerular filtration rate for LRI and HRI were -1.89 mL/min/1.73 m2/year and -6.82 mL/min/1.73 m2/year, respectively. Overall, the mean left ventricular posterior wall thickness and interventricular septum thickness remained unchanged and normal. Patients who initiated treatment at age {$\geq$}40 years exhibited significant increase in left ventricular posterior wall thickness and interventricular septum thickness. Mean plasma globotriaosylceramide normalised within 6 months. Conclusions This 10-year study documents the effectiveness of agalsidase beta (1 mg/kg/2 weeks) in patients with Fabry disease. Most patients remained alive and event-free. Patients who initiated treatment at a younger age and with less kidney involvement benefited the most from therapy. Patients who initiated treatment at older ages and/or had advanced renal disease experienced disease progression.},

  abstract = {Introduction Recent studies have shown that the baseline QRS area is associated with the clinical response after cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). In this study, we investigated the association of QRS area reduction ({$\increment$}QRS area) after CRT with the outcome. We hypothesize that a larger {$\increment$}QRS area is associated with a better survival and echocardiographic response. Methods and Results Electrocardiograms (ECG) obtained before and 2\textendash 12 months after CRT from 1299 patients in a multi-center CRT-registry were analyzed. The QRS area was calculated from vectorcardiograms that were synthesized from 12-lead ECGs. The primary endpoint was a combination of all-cause mortality, heart transplantation, and left ventricular (LV) assist device implantation. The secondary endpoint was the echocardiographic response, defined as LV end-systolic volume reduction {$\geq$} of 15\%. Patients with {$\increment$}QRS area above the optimal cut-off value (62 \textmu Vs) had a lower risk of reaching the primary endpoint (hazard ratio: 0.43; confidence interval [CI] 0.33\textendash 0.56, p {$<$} .001), and a higher chance of echocardiographic response (odds ratio [OR] 3.3;CI 2.4\textendash 4.6, p {$<$} .0001). In multivariable analysis, {$\increment$}QRS area was independently associated with both endpoints. In patients with baseline QRS area {$\geq$}109 \textmu Vs, survival, and echocardiographic response were better when the {$\increment$}QRS area was {$\geq$}62 \textmu Vs (p {$<$} .0001). Logistic regression showed that in patients with baseline QRS area {$\geq$}109 \textmu Vs, {$\increment$}QRS area was the only significant predictor of survival (OR: 0.981; CI: 0.967\textendash 0.994, p = .006). Conclusion {$\increment$}QRS area is an independent determinant of CRT response, especially in patients with a large baseline QRS area. Failure to achieve a large QRS area reduction with CRT is associated with a poor clinical outcome.},

  abstract = {Objectives This study was conceived to evaluate the relationship between interventricular electrical delay, as measured by the right ventricle-left ventricle (RV-LV) interval, and outcomes in a prospectively designed substudy of the SMART-AV (SMARTDELAY determined AV Optimization) trial. Background Despite the well-documented benefit of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), the nonresponder rate remains an important clinical problem. Implanting LV leads by traditional anatomic criteria has limited impact on outcomes. However, pacing at sites with late electrical activation improves CRT response rates. Thus, we hypothesized that interventricular electrical delay is associated with improved CRT outcomes. Methods This was a multicenter study of patients with advanced heart failure undergoing CRT implantation. In 419 subjects, the unpaced RV-LV interval was measured in sinus rhythm. LV volumes and ejection fraction were measured by echocardiography at baseline and after 6 months of CRT by a blinded core laboratory. Quality of life (QOL) was assessed by a standardized questionnaire. Results When separated by quartiles based on interventricular delay, the magnitudes of LV volumes, ejection fraction and the QOL measure increased significantly with prolongation of RV-LV delay (p~{$<$} 0.05). The LV end-systolic volume response rate increased progressively from 30\% to 75\% (p~{$<$} 0.001), and the QOL response rate increased from 50\% to 65\% (p~= 0.08). Patients in the highest quartile of RV-LV had a 5.98-fold increase (p~{$<$} 0.001) in their odds of a reverse remodeling response, with female sex, ischemic etiology, and baseline LV end-systolic volume being the other independent predictors of response. Conclusions Baseline interventricular delay is a potent independent predictor of remodeling and QOL responses with CRT.},

  abstract = {Echocardiography plays an evolving and important role in the care of heart failure patients treated with biventricular pacing, or cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). Numerous recent published reports have utilized echocardiographic techniques to potentially aide in patient selection for CRT prior to implantation and to optimized device settings afterwards. However, no ideal approach has yet been found. This consensus report evaluates the contemporary applications of echocardiography for CRT including relative strengths and technical limitations of several techniques and proposes guidelines regarding current and possible future clinical applications. Principal methods advised to qualify abnormalities in regional ventricular activation, known as dyssynchrony, include longitudinal velocities by color-coded tissue Doppler and the difference in left ventricular to right ventricular ejection using routine pulsed Doppler, or interventricular mechanical delay. Supplemental measures of radial dynamics which may be of additive value include septal-to-posterior wall delay using M-mode in patients with non-ischemic disease with technically high quality data, or using speckle tracking radial strain. A simplified post-CRT screening for atrioventricular optimization using Doppler mitral inflow velocities is also proposed. Since this is rapidly changing field with new information being added frequently, future modification and refinements in approach are anticipated to continue.},

Methods and Results\textemdash{} A prospective, longitudinal study was designed with predefined dyssynchrony indexes and outcome variables to test the hypothesis that baseline dyssynchrony is associated with long-term survival after CRT. We studied 229 consecutive class III to IV heart failure patients with ejection fraction {$\leq$}35 and QRS duration {$\geq$}120 milliseconds for CRT. Dyssynchrony before CRT was defined as tissue Doppler velocity opposing-wall delay {$\geq$}65 milliseconds, 12-site SD (Yu Index) {$\geq$}32 milliseconds, speckle tracking radial strain anteroseptal-to-posterior wall delay {$\geq$}130 milliseconds, or pulsed Doppler interventricular mechanical delay {$\geq$}40 milliseconds. Outcome was defined as freedom from death, heart transplantation, or left ventricular assist device implantation. Of 210 patients (89) with dyssynchrony data available, there were 62 events: 47 deaths, 9 transplantations, and 6 left ventricular assist device implantations over 4 years. Event-free survival was associated with Yu Index (P=0.003), speckle tracking radial strain (P=0.003), and interventricular mechanical delay (P=0.019). When adjusted for confounding baseline variables of ischemic origin and QRS duration, Yu Index and radial strain dyssynchrony remained independently associated with outcome (P{$<$}0.05). Lack of radial dyssynchrony was particularly associated with unfavorable outcome in those with QRS duration of 120 to 150 milliseconds (P=0.002). Conclusions\textemdash{} The absence of echocardiographic dyssynchrony was associated with significantly less favorable event-free survival after CRT.

They included patients with QRS width 120 to 149 ms or non-left bundle branch block (LBBB), where clinical uncertainty for CRT exists. They further tested the hypothesis that global longitudinal strain (GLS) has additional prognostic value. Background Response to CRT is variable. Guidelines favor patient selection by electrocardiographic LBBB with QRS width~{$\geq$}150 ms. Methods The authors studied 442 patients enrolled in the Adaptive CRT 94-site randomized trial with New York Heart Association functional class III\textendash IV heart failure, ejection fraction~{$\leq$}35\%, and QRS~{$\geq$}120 ms. A novel computer program semiautomatically calculated the SSI from strain curves as the sum of posterolateral prestretch percent before aortic valve opening and the septal rebound stretch percent during ejection. The primary endpoint was hospitalization for heart failure (HF) or death, and the secondary endpoint was death over 2 years after~CRT. Results In all patients, high longitudinal SSI ({$\geq$} group median of 3.1\%) was significantly associated with freedom from the primary endpoint of HF hospitalization or death (hazard ratio [HR] for low SSI: 2.17; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.45 to 3.24, p~{$<$} 0.001) and secondary endpoint of death (HR for low SSI: 4.06; 95\% CI: 1.95 to 8.45, p~{$<$} 0.001). Among the 203 patients with QRS 120 to 149 ms or non-LBBB, those with high longitudinal SSI ({$\geq$} group median of 2.6\%) had significantly fewer HF hospitalizations or deaths (HR for low SSI: 2.08; 95\% CI: 1.27 to 3.41, p~= 0.004) and longer survival (HR for low SSI: 5.08; 95\% CI: 1.94 to 13.31, p~{$<$} 0.001), similar to patients with LBBB~{$\geq$}150 ms. SSI by circumferential strain had similar associations with clinical outcomes, and GLS was additive to SSI in predicting clinical events (p~= 0.001). Conclusions Systolic stretch by strain imaging characterized the myocardial substrate associated with favorable CRT response, including in the important patient subgroup with QRS width 120 to 149 ms or non-LBBB.

Physicians are only partially aware of programming pitfalls related to LV sensing and general programming advice is lacking. Methods and Results: We provide an illustrative case\textendash series-based review of the variety of potential problems with LV sensing. LV sensing may inappropriately impair CRT delivery due to LV-sensing issues or improper device programming. This can cause beat-wise loss of resynchronization but also ongoing desynchronization. On the other hand, LV sensing provides additional diagnostic information, which may reveal intermittent problems of the LV lead such as capture loss. We summarize the available evidence to provide manufacturer-specific recommendations on device programming and troubleshooting for daily clinical practice. Conclusion: CRT devices with LV sensing may suffer from impaired resynchronization due to programming pitfalls. If LV sensing is active (nominal setting in Biotronik and Boston Scientific devices), careful lookout for related problems and resynchronization percentage is required. Optimization is mandatory and even deactivation of LV sensing may have to be considered.},

  abstract = {Background: Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) has been shown to decrease mortality in 60-70\% of advanced heart failure patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB) and QRS duration {$>$}120 ms. There have been intense efforts to find reproducible non-invasive parameters to predict CRT response. We hypothesized that different left ventricular contraction patterns may exist in LBBB patients with depressed systolic function and applied tagged cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) to assess circumferential strain in this population. Methods: We determined myocardial circumferential strain at the basal, mid, and apical ventricular level in 35 subjects (10 with ischemic cardiomyopathy, 15 with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, and 10 healthy controls). Patterns of circumferential strain were analyzed. Time to peak systolic circumferential strain in each of the 6 segments in all three ventricular slices and the standard deviation of time to peak strain in the basal and mid ventricular slices were determined. Results: Dyskinesis of the anterior septum and the inferior septum in at least two ventricular levels was seen in 50\% (5 out of 10) of LBBB patients while 30\% had isolated dyskinesis of the anteroseptum, and 20\% had no dyskinesis in any segments, similar to all of the non-LBBB patients and healthy controls. Peak circumferential strain shortening was significantly reduced in all cardiomyopathy patients at the mid-ventricular level (LBBB 9 +/- 6\%, non-LBBB 10 +/- 4\% vs. healthy 19 +/- 4\%; both p {$<$} 0.0001 compared to healthy), but was similar among the LBBB and non-LBBB groups (p = 0.20). The LBBB group had significantly greater dyssynchrony compared to the non-LBBB group and healthy controls assessed by opposing wall delays and 12-segment standard deviation (LBBB 164 +/- 30 ms vs. non-LBBB 70 +/- 17 ms (p {$<$} 0.0001), non-LBBB vs. healthy 65 +/- 17 ms (p = 0.47)). Conclusions: Septal dyskinesis exists in some patients with LBBB. Myocardial circumferential strain analysis enables detailed characterization of contraction patterns, strengths, and timing in cardiomyopathy patients with and without LBBB.},

Study Design and Setting This article distinguishes two of the major uses of regression models that imply very different sample size considerations, neither served well by the 2SPV rule. The first is etiological research, which contrasts mean Y levels at differing ``exposure'' (X) values and thus tends to focus on a single regression coefficient, possibly adjusted for confounders. The second research genre guides clinical practice. It addresses Y levels for individuals with different covariate patterns or ``profiles.'' It focuses on the profile-specific (mean) Y levels themselves, estimating them via linear compounds of regression coefficients and covariates. Results and Conclusion By drawing on long-established closed-form variance formulae that lie beneath the standard errors in multiple regression, and by rearranging them for heuristic purposes, one arrives at quite intuitive sample size considerations for both research genres.},

  abstract = {Multivariable regression models are powerful tools that are used frequently in studies of clinical outcomes. These models can use a mixture of categorical and continuous variables and can handle partially observed (censored) responses. However, uncritical application of modelling techniques can result in models that poorly fit the dataset at hand, or, even more likely, inaccurately predict outcomes on new subjects. One must know how to measure qualities of a model's fit in order to avoid poorly fitted or overfitted models. Measurement of predictive accuracy can be difficult for survival time data in the presence of censoring. We discuss an easily interpretable index of predictive discrimination as well as methods for assessing calibration of predicted survival probabilities. Both types of predictive accuracy should be unbiasedly validated using bootstrapping or cross-validation, before using predictions in a new data series. We discuss some of the hazards of poorly fitted and overfitted regression models and present one modelling strategy that avoids many of the problems discussed.

  abstract = {Regression models such as the Cox proportional hazards model have had increasing use in modelling and estimating the prognosis of patients with a variety of diseases. Many applications involve a large number of variables to be modelled using a relatively small patient sample. Problems of overfitting and of identifying important covariates are exacerbated in analysing prognosis because the accuracy of a model is more a function of the number of events than of the sample size. We used a general index of predictive discrimination to measure the ability of a model developed on training samples of varying sizes to predict survival in an independent test sample of patients suspected of having coronary artery disease. We compared three methods of model fitting: (1) standard `step-up' variable selection, (2) incomplete principal components regression, and (3) Cox model regression after developing clinical indices from variable clusters. We found regression using principal components to offer superior predictions in the test sample, whereas regression using indices offers easily interpretable models nearly as good as the principal components models. Standard variable selection has a number of deficiencies.},

The purpose of this study was to investigate the beat-to-beat spatial and temporal variations of ventricular depolarization and repolarization in vectorcardiogram (VCG) for characterising myocardial infarction (MI) patients. Methods Standard 12-lead ECGs of 84 MI patients (22 f, 63{$\pm$}12 yrs; 62 m, 56{$\pm$}10 yrs) and 69 healthy subjects (17 f, 42{$\pm$}18 yrs; 52 m, 40{$\pm$}13 yrs) were investigated. To extract the beat-to-beat QT intervals, a template-matching algorithm and the singular value decomposition method have been applied to synthesise the ECG data to VCG. Spatial and temporal variations in the QRS complex and T-wave loops were studied by investigating several descriptors (point-to-point distance variability, mean loop length, T-wave morphology dispersion, percentage of loop area, total cosine R-to-T). Results Point-to-point distance variability of QRS and T-loops (0.13{$\pm$}0.04 vs. 0.10{$\pm$}0.04, p{$<$} 0.0001 and 0.16{$\pm$}0.07 vs. 0.13{$\pm$}0.06, p{$<$} 0.05) were significantly larger in the MI group than in the control group. The average T-wave morphology dispersion was significantly higher in the MI group than in the control group (62\textdegree{$\pm$}8\textdegree{} vs. 38\textdegree{$\pm$}16\textdegree, p{$<$} 0.0001). Further, its beat-to-beat variability appeared significantly lower in the MI group than in the control group (12\textdegree{$\pm$}5\textdegree{} vs. 15\textdegree{$\pm$}6\textdegree, p{$<$} 0.005). Moreover, the average percentage of the T-loop area was found significantly lower in the MI group than the controls (46{$\pm$}17 vs. 55{$\pm$}15, p{$<$} 0.001). Finally, the average and beat-to-beat variability of total cosine R-to-T were not found statistically significant between both groups. Conclusions Beat-to-beat assessment of VCG parameters may have diagnostic attributes that might help in identifying MI patients.},

  abstract = {In exciting new work, Bertsimas et al. (2016) showed that the classical best subset selection problem in regression modeling can be formulated as a mixed integer optimization (MIO) problem. Using recent advances in MIO algorithms, they demonstrated that best subset selection can now be solved at much larger problem sizes that what was thought possible in the statistics community. They presented empirical comparisons of best subset selection with other popular variable selection procedures, in particular, the lasso and forward stepwise selection. Surprisingly (to us), their simulations suggested that best subset selection consistently outperformed both methods in terms of prediction accuracy. Here we present an expanded set of simulations to shed more light on these comparisons. The summary is roughly as follows: (a) neither best subset selection nor the lasso uniformly dominate the other, with best subset selection generally performing better in high signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio regimes, and the lasso better in low SNR regimes; (b) best subset selection and forward stepwise perform quite similarly throughout; (c) the relaxed lasso (actually, a simplified version of the original relaxed estimator defined in Meinshausen, 2007) is the overall winner, performing just about as well as the lasso in low SNR scenarios, and as well as best subset selection in high SNR scenarios.},

  abstract = {Statistical models support medical research by facilitating individualized outcome prognostication conditional on independent variables or by estimating effects of risk factors adjusted for covariates. Theory of statistical models is well-established if the set of independent variables to consider is fixed and small. Hence, we can assume that effect estimates are unbiased and the usual methods for confidence interval estimation are valid. In routine work, however, it is not known a priori which covariates should be included in a model, and often we are confronted with the number of candidate variables in the range 10\textendash 30. This number is often too large to be considered in a statistical model. We provide an overview of various available variable selection methods that are based on significance or information criteria, penalized likelihood, the change-in-estimate criterion, background knowledge, or combinations thereof. These methods were usually developed in the context of a linear regression model and then transferred to more generalized linear models or models for censored survival data. Variable selection, in particular if used in explanatory modeling where effect estimates are of central interest, can compromise stability of a final model, unbiasedness of regression coefficients, and validity of p-values or confidence intervals. Therefore, we give pragmatic recommendations for the practicing statistician on application of variable selection methods in general (low-dimensional) modeling problems and on performing stability investigations and inference. We also propose some quantities based on resampling the entire variable selection process to be routinely reported by software packages offering automated variable selection algorithms.},

Data collection often hinges upon either manual chart review or ad hoc requests to technical experts who support legacy clinical systems. In order to facilitate this needed capacity for data exploration at our institution (Duke University Health System), we have designed and deployed a robust Web application for cohort identification and data extraction--the Duke Enterprise Data Unified Content Explorer (DEDUCE). DEDUCE is envisioned as a simple, web-based environment that allows investigators access to administrative, financial, and clinical information generated during patient care. By using business intelligence tools to create a view into Duke Medicine's enterprise data warehouse, DEDUCE provides a Guided Query functionality using a wizard-like interface that lets users filter through millions of clinical records, explore aggregate reports, and, export extracts. Researchers and QI specialists can obtain detailed patient- and observation-level extracts without needing to understand structured query language or the underlying database model. Developers designing such tools must devote sufficient training and develop application safeguards to ensure that patient-centered clinical researchers understand when observation-level extracts should be used. This may mitigate the risk of data being misunderstood and consequently used in an improper fashion.},

  abstract = {Fabry disease (FD) is an X-linked lysosomal storage disease and is the result of mutation in the {$\alpha$}-Galactosidase A gene; such mutations cause a deficiency in {$\alpha$}-Galactosidase A enzyme and an accumulation of glycosphingolipid in tissue. Affected males with classic FD have little or no enzyme activity and have an early onset of symptoms and signs, including acroparesthesias, hypohidrosis, angiokeratomas, gastrointestinal dysfunction and/or a characteristic corneal dystrophy during childhood/adolescence. Males with late-onset FD who have residual enzyme activity develop progressive multi-systemic involvement that leads to renal failure and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, as well as cerebrovascular disease; these events mostly occur during the fourth to seventh decades of life. Heterozygous females can develop vital organ damage that in turn causes severe morbidity and mortality; these symptoms may be as severe as those in affected males. For the treatable disease, this review aims to raise awareness of early recognition and further management of FD based on newborn screening. As newborn screening for FD has been implemented worldwide, it allows the early detection of individuals with Fabry mutations. Based on screening studies, the prevalence of the later-onset type FD is much higher than that of classical type FD. Newborn screening studies have also revealed that patients with FD may develop insidious but ongoing irreversible organ damage. The timing of enzyme replacement therapy, which is able to stabilize the progression of disease, is important in order to prevent irreversible organ damage. Therapies that may become available in the future include pharmacological chaperones and substrate reduction therapy, both of which are still under investigation as ways of improving the health of individuals with FD.},

Background Coronary microvascular dysfunction results in impaired global CFR and is implicated in the development of both atherosclerosis and heart failure. Although noninvasive assessment of CFR with positron emission tomography provides independent prognostic information, the incremental prognostic value of CMR-derived CFR remains unclear. Methods Consecutive patients undergoing stress perfusion CMR were prospectively enrolled (n~= 507). Coronary sinus flow was measured using phase-contrast imaging at baseline (pre) and immediately after stress (peak) perfusion. CFR was calculated as the ratio of peak to pre-flow. Patients were followed for major adverse cardiac events (MACE): death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, heart failure hospitalization, sustained ventricular tachycardia, and late revascularization. Cox proportional hazards regression modeling was used to examine the association between CFR and MACE. The incremental prognostic value of CFR was assessed in nested models. Results Over a median follow-up of 2.1 years, 80 patients experienced MACE. By Kaplan-Meier analysis, the risk of MACE was significantly higher in patients with CFR lower than the median (2.2) (log-rank p~{$<$} 0.001); this remained significant after adjustment for the presence of ischemia and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) (log-rank p~{$<$} 0.001). CFR was significantly associated with the risk of MACE after adjustment for clinical and imaging risk factors, including ischemia extent, ejection fraction, and LGE size (hazard ratio: 1.238; p~= 0.018). Addition of CFR in this model resulted in significant improvement in the C-index (from 0.70 to 0.75; p~= 0.0087) and a continuous net reclassification improvement of 0.198 (95\% confidence interval: 0.120 to 0.288). Conclusions CMR-derived CFR is an independent predictor of MACE in patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease, incremental to common clinical and CMR risk factors. These findings suggest a role for CMR-derived CFR in~identifying patients at risk of adverse events following stress CMR, even in the absence of ischemia and LGE.},

  abstract = {Background: Trials using echocardiographic mechanical dyssynchrony (MD) parameters in narrow QRS patients have shown a negative response to CRT. We hypothesized MD in these patients may relate to myocardial scar rather than electrical dyssynchrony. Methods: We determined the prevalence of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) derived measures of MD in 130 systolic heart failure patients with both broad ({$>$}= 130 ms - BQRS) and narrow QRS duration ({$<$}130 ms - NQRS). We assessed whether late gadolinium enhancement derived scar might explain the presence of MD amongst narrow QRS patients. Dyssynchrony was calculated on the basis of a systolic dyssynchrony index (SDI). Results: Fifty-nine patients (45\%) had a NQRS and the remaining had QRS {$>$}= 130 ms (BQRS group). 25\% of NQRS patients had MD based on SDI. In all narrow and broad QRS patients with MD there was a significantly lower scar volume than those without MD (7.4 +/- 10.5\% vs 13.7 +/- 13.3\% vs. p{$<$}0.01). This was the case in the BQRS group with a significantly lower scar burden in patients with MD (5.0 +/- 7.7\% vs 15.4 +/- 15.6\%, p{$<$}0.01). Notably in the NQRS group this difference was absent with an equal scar burden in patients with MD 13.3 +/- 13.9\% and without MD 12.5 +/- 11\%, p=0.92. Conclusions: 25\% of patients with systolic heart failure and a NQRS ({$<$}130 ms) have CMR derived mechanical dyssynchrony. Our findings suggest MD in this group may be secondary to myocardial scar rather than electrical dyssynchrony and therefore not amenable to correction by CRT. This may give insight into non-response and potential harm from CRT in this group. (C) 2017 King's College London. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

Study Design and Setting We used data of 804 patients with a suspicion of deep venous thrombosis (DVT). We studied three covariates to predict the presence of DVT: d-dimer level, difference in calf circumference, and history of leg trauma. We introduced missing values (missing at random) ranging from 10\% to 90\%. The risk of DVT was modeled with logistic regression for the three methods, that is, complete case analysis, exclusion of d-dimer level from the model, and multiple imputation. Results Multiple imputation showed less bias in the regression coefficients of the three variables and more accurate coverage of the corresponding 90\% confidence intervals than complete case analysis and dropping d-dimer level from the analysis. Multiple imputation showed unbiased estimates of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.88) compared with complete case analysis (0.77) and when the variable with missing values was dropped (0.65). Conclusion As this study shows that simple methods to deal with missing data can lead to seriously misleading results, we advise to consider multiple imputation. The purpose of multiple imputation is not to create data, but to prevent the exclusion of observed data.},

  abstract = {Background Left bundle branch block (LBBB) is considered an important prognostic parameter in cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). We aimed to evaluate, in a sizeable cohort of patients with CRT, long-term mortality, and morbidity according to four different electrocardiographic definitions of LBBB. Methods This longitudinal cohort study included consecutive patients who underwent CRT device implantation in our institution in years 2006\textendash 2014. Two endpoints were assessed: (a) death from any cause or urgent heart transplantation, and (b) death from any cause or heart failure admission. All preimplantation ECGs were analyzed by three physicians blinded to outcome and categorized as LBBB or non-LBBB according to four definitions. Results A total of 552 CRT patients entered survival analysis. According to the conventional definition, 350 (63.4\%) patients had LBBB, and the Marriott, WHO/AHA, and Strauss definitions identified LBBB in 254 (46.0\%), 218 (39.5\%) and 226 (40.9\%) patients, respectively. During the 9 years of observation, 232 patients died, the combined endpoint was met by 292 patients. The Strauss LBBB definition was significantly better to the other definitions in predicting survival (Kaplan\textendash Meier analysis with comparison of C-statistics). Multivariate Cox regression model showed that LBBB was the major determinant of all-cause mortality with the Strauss definition having the lowest hazard ratio (0.51) of the four studied definitions. Conclusions Criteria included in various definitions of LBBB result in a diagnosis of LBBB in divergent groups of patients. Differences in LBBB definitions have clinical consequences, as patients without `complete/true' LBBB probably get no mortality benefit from CRT.},

Results In this population, aged 3.3 to 70.8~years, a strong correlation between age and left ventricular mass indexed (LVMi, g/m2.7) was found in both males and females (P{$<$}0.0001 for both). At the initial examination 48.6\% of the male patients and 36.4\% of the female patients were classified as having left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). The cumulative prevalence of LVH peaked at age 40~years in males and 60~years in females. In patients with longitudinal follow-up, LVMi increased by 4.07{$\pm$}1.03~g/m2.7 per year in males and by 2.31{$\pm$}0.81~g/m2.7 in females (P{$<$}0.01, Wilcoxon rank sum). In patients with LVH at baseline, the median progression rate was 5.52~g/m2.7 per year in males and by 1.80~g/m2.7 in females (P=0.12).

  abstract = {Cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT) is a cornerstone in the contemporary management of heart failure. The most effective way of predicting response to this therapy remains electrocardiographic (ECG) criteria of electromechanical dyssynchrony. The left bundle branch block (LBBB) pattern is currently the most robust ECG criterion in predicting improvement in symptoms and reduction in mortality. However, recent studies using three-dimensional (3D) mapping and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) have demonstrated heterogeneous left ventricular activation patterns in patients with LBBB. This has led to intense debate on the activation pattern of ``true LBBB'' and resulted in the proposal of stricter criteria for defining LBBB. This review will focus on the definitions and implications of LBBB in the CRT era. At a minimum, the use of stricter ECG criteria appears warranted, and adjunctive pre-implant imaging or mapping may further identify patient-specific electrophysiological patterns that determine response to CRT.},

  abstract = {Objectives We tested the hypothesis that an immediate reduction in mitral regurgitation (MR) after cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) results from improved coordinated timing of the papillary muscle insertion sites, using the novel approach of mechanical activation strain mapping. Background Heart failure patients with left bundle branch block often benefit acutely from CRT; however, the role and mechanism of reduction of MR are unclear. Methods Twenty-six consecutive patients undergoing CRT with at least mild MR were studied (ejection fraction 24 {$\pm$} 6\%; QRS duration 168 {$\pm$} 30 ms). Echocardiographic Doppler and strain imaging was performed immediately before and the day after CRT, as well as in 10 normal control subjects. Mechanical activation sequence maps were constructed using longitudinal strain from 12 basal and mid-LV sites, with color codingof time-to-peak strain. Results Mitral regurgitation by the volumetric method consistently decreased after CRT: regurgitant volume from 40 {$\pm$} 20 ml to 24 {$\pm$} 17 ml and regurgitant fraction from 40 {$\pm$} 12\% to 25 {$\pm$} 14\% (both: p {$<$} 0.001 vs. baseline). Normal controls had uniform segmental time-to-peak strain, with a difference of only 12 {$\pm$} 8 ms between all segments. In contrast, CRT patients at baseline had a 106 {$\pm$} 74 ms time delay between papillary muscle insertion sites (p {$<$} 0.001 vs. normal). This interpapillary muscle time delay shortened after CRT to 39 {$\pm$} 43 ms (p {$<$} 0.001 vs. baseline) and was significantly correlated with reductions in mitral regurgitant fraction (r = 0.77, p {$<$} 0.001). Conclusions Cardiac resynchronization therapy significantly and immediately reduced MR. Improved coordinated timing of mechanical activation of papillary muscle insertion sites appears to be a mechanistic contributor to immediate MR reduction by CRT.},

Myocardial fibrosis, either focal or diffuse, is a common feature of many cardiac diseases and is associated with a poor prognosis for major adverse cardiovascular events. Although histological analysis remains the gold standard for confirming the presence of myocardial fibrosis, endomyocardial biopsy is invasive, has sampling errors, and is not practical in the routine clinical setting. Cardiac imaging modalities offer noninvasive surrogate biomarkers not only for fibrosis but also for myocardial edema and infiltration to varying degrees, and have important roles in the diagnosis and management of cardiac diseases. This review summarizes important pathophysiological features in the development of commonly encountered cardiac diseases, and the principles, advantages, and disadvantages of various cardiac imaging modalities (echocardiography, single-photon emission computer tomography, positron emission tomography, multidetector computer tomography, and cardiac magnetic resonance) for myocardial tissue characterization, with an emphasis on imaging focal and diffuse myocardial fibrosis.},

  abstract = {Prolongation of QRS ({$\geq$}120 ms) occurs in 14\% to 47\% of heart failure (HF) patients. Left bundle branch block is far more common than right bundle branch block. Left-sided intraventricular conduction delay is associated with more advanced myocardial disease, worse left ventricular (LV) function, poorer prognosis, and a higher all-cause mortality rate compared with narrow QRS complex. It also predisposes heart failure patients to an increased risk of ventricular tachyarrhythmias, but the incidence of cardiac or sudden death remains unclear because of limited observations. A progressive increase in QRS duration worsens the prognosis. No electrocardiographic measure is specific enough to provide subgroup risk categorization for excluding or selecting HF patients for prophylactic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy. In ICD patients with HF, a wide underlying QRS complex more than doubles the cardiac mortality compared with a narrow QRS complex. There is a high incidence of an elevated defibrillation threshold at the time of ICD implantation in patients with QRS {$\geq$}200 ms. Mechanical LV dyssynchrony potentially treatable by ventricular resynchronization occurs in about 70\% of HF patients with left-sided intraventricular conduction delay, a fact that would explain the lack of therapeutic response in about 30\% of patients subjected to ventricular resynchronization according to standard criteria relying on QRS duration. The duration of the basal QRS complex does not reliably predict the clinical response to ventricular resynchronization, and QRS narrowing after cardiac resynchronization therapy does not correlate with hemodynamic and clinical improvement. Mechanical LV dyssynchrony is best shown by evolving echocardiographic techniques (predominantly tissue Doppler imaging) currently in the process of standardization.},

OBJECTIVES This study sought to evaluate clinical outcomes among Medicare-aged patients with nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay (NICD) versus right bundle branch block (RBBB) in patients eligible for implantation with a CRT with defibrillator (CRT-D). METHODS Using the National Cardiovascular Data Registry implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) registry data between 2010 and 2013, the authors compared outcomes in CRT-eligible patients implanted with CRT-D versus ICD-only therapy among patients with NICD and RBBB. Also, among all CRT-D\textendash implanted patients, the authors compared outcomes in those with NICD versus RBBB. Survival curves and multivariable adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were used to assess outcomes including hospitalization and death. RESULTS In 11,505 non-LBBB CRT-eligible patients, after multivariable adjustment, among patients with RBBB, CRT-D was not associated with better outcomes, compared with ICD alone, regardless of QRS duration. Among patients with NICD and a QRS \$150 ms, CRT-D was associated with decreased mortality at 3 years compared with ICD alone (HR: 0.602; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.416 to 0.871; p {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.0071). Among 5,954 CRT-D\textendash implanted patients, after multivariable adjustment NICD compared with RBBB was associated with lower mortality at 3 years in those with a QRS duration of \$150 ms (HR: 0.757; 95\% CI: 0.625 to 0.917; p {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.0044). CONCLUSIONS Among non-LBBB CRT-D\textendash eligible patients, CRT-D implantation was associated with better outcomes compared with ICD alone specifically in NICD patients with a QRS duration of \$150 ms. Careful patient selection should be considered for CRT-D implantation in patients with non-LBBB conduction.

As the use of late enhancement imaging has matured and the span of applications has widened, the demands on image quality have grown. The characterization of sub-endocardial MI now includes the accurate quantification of scar size, shape, and characterization of borders which have been shown to have prognostic significance. More diverse patterns of late enhancement including patchy, mid-wall, sub-epicardial, or diffuse enhancement are of interest in diagnosing non-ischemic cardiomyopathies. As clinicians are examining late enhancement images for more subtle indication of fibrosis, the demand for lower artifacts has increased. A range of new techniques have emerged to improve the speed and quality of late enhancement imaging including: methods for acquisition during free breathing, and fat water separated imaging for characterizing fibro-fatty infiltration and reduction of artifacts related to the presence of fat. Methods for quantification of T1 and extracellular volume fraction are emerging to tackle the issue of discriminating globally diffuse fibrosis from normal healthy tissue which is challenging using conventional late enhancement methods. The aim of this review will be to describe the current state of the art and to provide a guide to various clinical protocols that are commonly used.},

The stroke and mortality implications of NOAF in isolated CABG without concomitant valve surgery is not known. We thought that NOAF would be associated with increased risk of stroke and mortality, even in patients undergoing isolated CABG. A blinded review of studies from MEDLINE, CENTRAL, and Web of Science was done by two independent investigators. Stroke, 30-day/hospital mortality, long-term cardiovascular mortality, and long-term ({$>$}1 year) all-cause mortality were analyzed. We used Review Manager Version 5.3 to perform pooled analysis of outcomes. Of 4461 studies identified, 19 studies (n = 129 628) met inclusion criteria. NOAF incidence ranged from 15\% to 36\%. NOAF was associated with increased risk of stroke (unadjusted OR 2.15 [1.82, 2.53] [P {$<$} .00001]; adjusted OR 1.88 [1.02, 3.46] [P = .04]). NOAF was associated with increased 30-day/hospital mortality (OR 2.35 [1.67, 3.32] [P {$<$} .00001]) and long-term cardiovascular mortality (OR 2.04 [1.35, 3.09] [P = .0007]) NOAF was associated with increased long-term all-cause mortality (unadjusted OR 1.79 [1.63, 1.96] [P {$<$} .00001]; adjusted OR 1.58 [1.24, 2.00] [P = .0002]).

METHODS: Cardiovascular MRI at 1.5T was performed in 24 patients, 2.2 days post STEMI. Global and segmental circumferential (Ecc) and longitudinal (Ell) strain were assessed using FT and tagging, and correlated with total and segmental infarct size, area at risk and myocardial salvage. RESULTS: All segments tracked satisfactorily with FT (p{$<$}0.001 vs. tagging). Total analysis time per patient was shorter with FT (38.2+/-3.8 min vs. 63.7+/-10.3 min, p{$<$}0.001 vs. tagging). Global Ecc and Ell were higher with FT than with tagging, apart from FT Ecc using the average of endocardial and epicardial contours (-13.45+/-4.1 [FT] vs. -13.85+/-3.9 [tagging], p=0.66). Intraobserver and interobserver agreement for global strain were excellent for FT (ICC 0.906-0.990) but interobserver agreement for tagging was lower (ICC{$<$}0.765). Interobserver and intraobserver agreement for segmental strain was good for both techniques (ICC{$>$}0.7) apart from tagging Ell, which was poor (ICC=0.15). FT-derived Ecc significantly correlated with total infarct size (r=0.44, p=0.03) and segmental infarct extent (r=0.44, p{$<$}0.01), and best distinguished transmurally infarcted segments (AUC 0.77) and infarcted from adjacent and remote segments. FT-derived Ecc correlated strongest with segmental myocardial salvage (rs=-0.406). CONCLUSIONS: FT global Ecc and Ell measurement in acute STEMI is feasible and robust. FT-derived strain is quicker to analyse, tracks myocardium better, has better interobserver variability and correlated more strongly with infarct, area at risk (oedema), myocardial salvage and infarct transmurality.},

We aimed to compare clinical outcomes of narrow versus prolonged intraventricular conduction on ECG stratified by QRS morphology and cardiovascular disease (CVD) status. A post-hoc analysis was performed of the randomized-control PRECISION trial. Patients with centrally adjudicated, nonpaced baseline ECGs were included. QRS duration was classified narrow ({$\leq$}100 ms) versus prolonged ({$>$}100 ms) with additional categorization into left (LBBB) or right (RBBB) bundle branch block or nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay (IVCD). IVCD was subclassified if left ventricular conduction delay (LVCD) was present (L-IVCD) or absent (O-IVCD). The primary outcome was adjudicated all-cause and cardiovascular (CV) mortality. Of 24,081 patients randomized, 22,067 (92\%) were included with follow-up 34 {$\pm$} 13 months. Study patients were 63 {$\pm$} 9 years, 64\% female, 75\% Caucasian, 23\% with established CVD. The prevalence of QRS prolongation was 5.6\% (1,240): 760 right bundle branch block (3.4\%), 313 LBBB (1.4\%), and 161 IVCD (0.7\%), 95 subclassified L-IVCD (0.4\%). After adjustment, LBBB and L-IVCD were similarly associated with increased all-cause (LBBB: 2.3 [1.4 to 3.8], p\,=\,0.001; L-IVCD: 4.0 [2.1 to 7.9], p {$<$}0.001) and CV (LBBB: 3.6 [2.0 to 6.5], p {$<$}0.001; L-IVCD 3.6 [1.3 to 9.7], p\,=\,0.001) mortality. The presence of LVCD (LBBB or L-IVCD) was associated with all-cause (2.8 [1.8 to 4.2], p {$<$}0.001) and CV (3.6 [2.2 to 6.1], p {$<$}0.001) mortality exceeding the observed risks of coronary artery disease, left ventricular hypertrophy, or diabetes. The LVCD hazard persisted across QRS durations (100 to 120 vs {$>$}120 ms) and CVD status. In conclusion, LVCD, whether LBBB or L-IVCD, was strongly associated with increased mortality in patients with and at-risk for CVD.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES The aims of this study were to test the magnitude of agreement between echocardiography (echo)- and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)\textendash derived left atrial (LA) strain and to study their relative diagnostic performance in discriminating diastolic dysfunction (DD) and predicting atrial fibrillation (AF). BACKGROUNDS Peak atrial longitudinal strain (PALS) is a novel performance index. Utility of echo-quantified LA strain has yet to be prospectively tested in relation to current DD guidelines or compared to CMR. METHODS The study population comprised 257 post-myocardial infarction (MI) patients undergoing echo and CMR, including prospective derivation (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 157) and clinical validation (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 100) cohorts. DD was graded on echo using established consensus guidelines blinded to strain results. RESULTS PALS on both echo and CMR was nearly 2-fold lower among patients with versus no DD (p {$<$} 0.001) and was significantly different in those with mild versus no DD (p {$<$} 0.01). In contrast, LA geometric parameters including echoand CMR-derived volumes were significantly different between advanced versus no DD groups (p {$<$} 0.001) but not between groups with mild versus no DD (all p {$>$} 0.05). Echo and CMR PALS yielded small differences irrespective of orientation and similar diagnostic performance for DD in the derivation (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.70 to 0.78) and validation (AUC: 0.75 to 0.78) cohorts. Impaired PALS on both modalities was independently associated with MI size (p {$<$} 0.001). During 4.4 \AE{} 3.8 years of follow-up in the derivation cohort, 8\% developed AF. Both 2-chamber echo- and CMR-derived PALS stratified arrhythmic risk (p {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.004 and p {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.02, respectively), including a 4-fold difference among patients in the lowest versus remainder of quartiles of echo-derived PALS (24\% vs. 6\%). Similarly, echo and CMR PALS were lower (both p {$<$} 0.05) among patients with subsequent heart failure hospitalizations. CONCLUSIONS Echo-derived PALS parallels results of CMR, yields incremental diagnostic utility versus LA geometry for stratifying presence and severity of DD, and improves prediction of AF and congestive heart failure after MI.

We hypothesized that mechanical discoordination [opposite strain within the left ventricular (LV) wall] predicts reversal of LV remodeling upon CRT better than mechanical dyssynchrony. MRI tagging images were acquired in CRT candidates (n = 19) and in healthy control subjects (n = 9). Circumferential strain ({$\epsilon$}cc) was determined in 160 regions. From {$\epsilon$}cc signals we derived 1) an index of mechanical discoordination [internal stretch fraction (ISF), defined as the ratio of stretch to shortening during ejection] and 2) indexes of mechanical dyssynchrony: the 10\textendash 90\% width of time to onset of shortening, time to peak shortening, and end-systolic strain. LV end-diastolic volume (LVEDV), end-systolic volume (LVESV), and ejection fraction (LVEF) were determined before and after 3 mo of CRT. Responders were defined as those patients in whom LVESV decreased by {$>$}15\%. In responders (n = 10), CRT increased LVEF and decreased LVEDV and LVESV (11 {$\pm$} 6\%, 21 {$\pm$} 16\%, and 30 {$\pm$} 16\%, respectively) significantly more (P {$<$} 0.05) than in nonresponders (1 {$\pm$} 6\%, 3 {$\pm$} 4\%, and 5 {$\pm$} 10\%, respectively). Among mechanical indexes, only ISF was different between responders and nonresponders (0.53 {$\pm$} 0.25 vs. 0.31 {$\pm$} 0.16; P {$<$} 0.05). In patients with ISF {$>$}0.4 (n = 10), LVESV decreased by 31 {$\pm$} 18\% vs. 5 {$\pm$} 11\% in patients with ISF {$<$}0.4 (P {$<$} 0.05). We conclude that mechanical discoordination, as estimated from ISF, is a better predictor of reverse remodeling after CRT than differences in time to onset and time to peak shortening. Therefore, discoordination rather than dyssynchrony appears to reflect the reserve contractile capacity that can be recruited by CRT.},

Blood gas analysis and electrolyte concentrations measured by the portable analyzers VetStat and epoc were compared to those produced by the cobas b 123 analyzer via concordance analysis, Passing-Bablok regression and Bland-Altman analysis. Limits of agreement indicated relevant bias between the VetStat and cobas b 123 for partial pressure of oxygen (pO2; 27.5\textendash 33.8 mmHg), sodium ([Na+]; 4.3\textendash 21.6 mmol/L) and chloride concentration ([Cl-]; 0.3\textendash 7.9 mmol/L) and between the epoc and cobas b 123 for pH (0.070\textendash 0.022), partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2; 3.6\textendash 7.3 mmHg), pO2 (36.2\textendash 32.7 mmHg) and [Na+] (0.38.1 mmol/L). The VetStat analyzer yielded results that were in agreement with the cobas b 123 analyzer for determination of pH, pCO2, bicarbonate ([HCO3-]) and potassium concentration [K+], while the epoc analyzer achieved acceptable agreement for [HCO3-] and [K+]. The VetStat analyzer may be useful in performing blood gas analysis in equine samples but analysis of [Na+], [Cl-] and pO2 should be interpreted with caution.

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The mechanism of mechanical dyssynchrony in postinfarction patients with a narrow QRS complex is not defined but essential for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). METHODS AND RESULTS: Left ventricular electrical activation and subsequent wall motion were recorded for 16 patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy during intrinsic rhythm using a modified NOGA electromechanical mapping system. Ten patients presented mechanical dyssynchrony on tissue Doppler imaging, while 6 patients served as control subjects. The local activation time (LAT) was set by the maximum downslope of the unipolar electrogram. Local wall motion time (LMT) was defined as the time needed for the catheter tip to traverse half of its maximum inward deflection during systole. LAT and LMT were measured relative to the onset of the QRS complex. Electrical activation showed a septal-to-lateral pattern in all patients with a mean endocardial activation time of 65 +/- 13 ms. Control subjects exhibited 97.5\% of all LMTs {$<$}290 +/- 17 ms. Delayed motion areas (cut-off LMT {$>$} 300 ms) showed no slowing of conduction. Wall motion time corrected for differences in electrical activation (LMT-LAT) was significantly longer in delayed (289 +/- 34 ms) than in regular (204 +/- 24 ms) motion areas (P = 0.002). Delayed motion segments were hypokinetic on echocardiography and presented a lower maximum inward motion (9.9 +/- 1.1 mm) compared to regular segments (10.9 +/- 1.2 mm) on electromechanical maps (P = 0.004). Viability, however, was preserved with unipolar and bipolar voltage amplitude {$>$}7 mV and {$>$}1.5 mV for 79\% of all delayed motion areas. CONCLUSION: Dyssynchronous segments of an ischemic myocardium show unimpaired local activation but slow wall motion, thereby limiting the benefit of ventricular preexcitation via CRT.},

This study aimed to validate maximum stress myocardial blood flow (SMBF) measured using quantitative perfusion mapping for assessment of hyperaemic response and compare this to current clinical markers of adenosine stress.Two hundred and eighteen subjects underwent adenosine stress CMR. A derivation cohort (22 volunteers) was used to identify a SMBF threshold value for hyperaemia. This was tested in a validation cohort (37 patients with suspected coronary artery disease) who underwent invasive coronary physiology assessment on the same day as CMR. A clinical cohort (159 patients) was used to compare SMBF to other physiological markers of hyperaemia [splenic switch-off (SSO), heart rate response (HRR), and blood pressure (BP) fall]. A minimum SMBF threshold of 1.43\,mL/g/min was derived from volunteer scans. All patients in the coronary physiology cohort demonstrated regional maximum SMBF (SMBFmax) \&gt;1.43\,mL/g/min and invasive evidence of hyperaemia. Of the clinical cohort, 93\% had hyperaemia defined by perfusion mapping compared to 71\% using SSO and 81\% using HRR. There was no difference in SMBFmax in those with or without SSO (2.58\,{$\pm$}\,0.89 vs. 2.54\,{$\pm$}\,1.04\,mL/g/min, P\,=\,0.84) but those with HRR had significantly higher SMBFmax (2.66 1.86\,mL/g/min, P\,\&lt;\,0.001). HRR \&gt;15\,bpm was superior to SSO in predicting adequate increase in SMBF (AUC 0.87 vs. 0.62, P\,\&lt;\,0.001).Adenosine-induced increase in myocardial blood flow is accurate for confirmation of hyperaemia during stress CMR studies and is superior to traditional, clinically used markers of adequate stress such as SSO and BP response.},

Furthermore, 4D-LV-analysis based on SSFP short-axis stacks and longitudinal planes was performed to quantify 4D-volume-SDI. Setting A single-centre London teaching hospital. Participants 16 healthy volunteers. Main outcome measures Inter-study reproducibility between the repeated exams. Results CURE and RURE as well as 4D-volume-SDI showed good inter-study reproducibility (coefficient of variation [CoV] 6.4\%\textendash 12.9\%). Circumferential strain and area-SDI showed higher variability between the repeated measurements (CoV 24.9\%\textendash 37.5\%). Uniformity ratio estimates showed the lowest inter-study variability (CoV 6.4\%\textendash 8.5\%). Conclusions Derivation of LV mechanical dyssynchrony measures from standard cine images is feasible using CMR-FT and 4D-LV-analysis tools. Uniformity ratio estimates and 4D-volume-SDI showed good inter-study reproducibility.

During a median follow-up of 2.5 years, the risk of the primary composite endpoint was higher among those with a wide QRS, irrespective of morphology: hazard ratios (95\% confidence interval) LBBB 1.36 (1.23\textendash 1.50), RBBB 1.54 (1.31\textendash 1.79), non-specific IVCD 1.65 (1.40\textendash 1.94) and QRS 110\textendash 129 ms 1.35 (1.23\textendash 1.47), compared with QRS duration {$<$}110 ms. A total of 1234 (15.6\%) patients developed new-onset QRS widening {$\geq$}130 ms (6.1 per 100 patient-years). Incident LBBB occurred in 495 (6.3\%) patients (2.4 per 100 patient-years) and was associated with a higher risk of the primary composite outcome [hazard ratio 1.42 (1.12\textendash 1.82)]. Conclusion In patients with HFrEF, a wide QRS was associated with worse clinical outcomes irrespective of morphology. The annual incidence of new-onset LBBB was around 2.5\%, and associated with a higher risk of adverse outcomes, highlighting the importance of repeat electrocardiogram review.

  abstract = {Background Combined measurement of electrical activation and mechanical dyssynchrony in heart failure (HF) patients is scarce but may contain important mechanistic and diagnostic clues. Objective The purpose of this study was to characterize the electromechanical (EM) coupling in HF patients with prolonged QRS duration. Methods Ten patients with QRS width {$>$}120 ms underwent left ventricular (LV) electroanatomic contact mapping using the Noga\textregistered{} XP system (Biosense Webster). Recorded voltages during the cardiac cycle were converted to maps of depolarization time (TD). Electrode positions were tracked and converted into maps of time-to-peak shortening (TPS) using custom-made deformation analysis software. Correlation analysis was performed between the 2 maps to quantify EM coupling. Simulations with the CircAdapt cardiovascular system model were performed to mechanistically unravel the observed relation between TD and TPS. Results The delay between earliest LV electrical activation and peak shortening differed considerably between patients (TPSmin\textendash TDmin = 360 {$\pm$} 73 ms). On average, total mechanical dyssynchrony exceeded total electrical activation ({$\Delta$}TPS = 177 {$\pm$} 47 ms vs {$\Delta$}TD = 93 {$\pm$} 24 ms, P {$<$}.001), but a large interpatient variability was observed. The TD and TPS maps correlated strongly in all patients (median R = 0.87, P {$<$}.001). These correlations were similar for regions with unipolar voltages above and below 6mV (Mann\textendash Whitney U test, P = .93). Computer simulations revealed that increased passive myocardial stiffness decreases {$\Delta$}TPS relative to {$\Delta$}TD and that lower contractility predominantly increases TPSmin\textendash TDmin. Conclusion EM coupling in HF patients is maintained, but the relationship between TD and TPS differs strongly between patients. Intra-individual and inter-individual differences may be explained by local and global differences in passive and contractile myocardial properties.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Today feature tracking (FT) is considered to be a robust assessment tool in cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) for strain assessment. The FT algorithm is dependent on a high contrast between blood pool and myocardium. Extracellular contrast agents decrease blood-myocardial contrast in SSFP images and thus might affect FT results. However, in a routine CMR scan, SSFP-cine images including short axis views are partly acquired after contrast agent injection. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of extracellular contrast agent (Gadobutrol) (CA) on the precision and reproducibility of the feature tracking algorithm. METHODS: A total of 40 patient volunteers (mean age 51.2 +/- 19 years; mean LVEF 61 +/- 9 \%) were scanned in supine position on a clinical 1.5 T MR scanner (Philips Ingenia). SSFP-cine images in midventricular short axis view (SA) as well as horizontal long axis view (HLA) were acquired before and 10-15 min after injection of a double dose Gadobutrol. FT derived systolic circumferential and longitudinal strain parameters were then calculated for pre- and post-contrast images. RESULTS: FT derived midventricular peak systolic circumferential strain (PSCS) (-24.8 +/- 6.4 \% vs. -20.4 +/- 6.3 \%), apical PSCS (-28.67 +/- 6.5 \% vs. -24.06 +/- 8.5 \%), basal PSCS (-24.42 \% +/- 6.5 vs. -20.68 +/- 7.1 \%), peak systolic longitudinal strain (-19.57 +/- 3.3 \% vs. -17.24 +/- 4.1 \%), midventricular epicardial PSCS (-9.84 +/- 3.4 \% vs. -8.13 +/- 3.4 \%) , midventricular PSCS-rate (-1.52 +/- 0.4 vs. -1.28 +/- 0.5) and peak diastolic circumferential strain rate (1.4 +/- 0.5 vs. 1.05 +/- 0.5) were significantly reduced after CA application. Post CA strain assessment showed higher intra- and interobserver variability. Pre-CA: intraobserver: mean 0.21, Limits of agreement (LoA) -2.8 and 3.2; interobserver: mean 0.64, LoA -2.8 and 4.1. Post-CA: intraobserver: mean -0.11, LoA -5.1 to 4.9; interobserver: mean 4.93 LoA 2.4 to 12.2. CONCLUSION: The FT algorithm is dependent on a high contrast between blood and myocardium. Post CA strain results are significantly lower and less reproducible than pre-CA strain results.},

Up to 70\% of patients undergoing invasive angiography do not have obstructive coronary artery disease, more common in women than in men, and a large proportion have INOCA as a cause of their symptoms. INOCA patients present with a wide spectrum of symptoms and signs that are often misdiagnosed as non-cardiac leading to under-diagnosis/investigation and under-treatment. INOCA can result from heterogeneous mechanism including coronary vasospasm and microvascular dysfunction and is not a benign condition. Compared to asymptomatic individuals, INOCA is associated with increased incidence of cardiovascular events, repeated hospital admissions, as well as impaired quality of life and associated increased health care costs. This consensus document provides a definition of INOCA and guidance to the community on the diagnostic approach and management of INOCA based on existing evidence from research and best available clinical practice; noting gaps in knowledge and potential areas for further investigation.},

  abstract = {Sparsely sampled cardiac cine accelerated acquisitions show promise for faster evaluation of left-ventricular function. Myocardial strain estimation using image feature tracking methods is also becoming widespread. However, it is not known whether highly accelerated acquisitions also provide reliable feature tracking strain estimates. Twenty patients and twenty healthy volunteers were imaged with conventional 14-beat/slice cine acquisition (STD), 4\texttimes{} accelerated 4-beat/slice acquisition with iterative reconstruction (R4), and a 9.2\texttimes{} accelerated 2-beat/slice real-time acquisition with sparse sampling and iterative reconstruction (R9.2). Radial and circumferential strains were calculated using non-rigid registration in the mid-ventricle short-axis slice and inter-observer errors were evaluated. Consistency was assessed using intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) and bias with Bland\textendash Altman analysis. Peak circumferential strain magnitude was highly consistent between STD and R4 and R9.2 (ICC = 0.876 and 0.884, respectively). Average bias was -1.7 {$\pm$} 2.0 \%, p {$<$} 0.001, for R4 and -2.7 {$\pm$} 1.9 \%, p {$<$} 0.001 for R9.2. Peak radial strain was also highly consistent (ICC = 0.829 and 0.785, respectively), with average bias -11.2 {$\pm$} 18.4 \%, p {$<$} 0.001, for R4 and -15.0 {$\pm$} 21.2 \%, p {$<$} 0.001 for R9.2. STD circumferential strain could be predicted by linear regression from R9.2 with an R2 of 0.82 and a root mean squared error of 1.8 \%. Similarly, radial strain could be predicted with an R2 of 0.67 and a root mean squared error of 21.3 \%. Inter-observer errors were not significantly different between methods, except for peak circumferential strain R9.2 (1.1 {$\pm$} 1.9 \%) versus STD (0.3 {$\pm$} 1.0 \%), p = 0.011. Although small systematic differences were observed in strain, these were highly consistent with standard acquisitions, suggesting that accelerated myocardial strain is feasible and reliable in patients who require short acquisition durations.},

  abstract = {Bias analysis serves multiple objectives in epidemiologic data analysis. The objectives most often emphasized are quantification of uncertainty due to systematic errors and reduction in overconfidence by specifying hypotheses that compete with the causal hypothesis. A third objective is the utility of bias analysis to identify strategies for new data collection that will be productive in evaluating the validity of an association. The authors illustrate the value of this objective using two examples. The first example examines the value of comprehensive CYP2D6 genotyping in a study of tamoxifen resistance. Tamoxifen is metabolized primarily by CYP2D6 to more active forms. More than thirty polymorphisms in the CYP2D6 gene reduce its function. We genotyped the most prevalent CYP2D6 polymorphism and found a null association between genotype and breast cancer recurrence in a Danish population. One possibility is that incomplete genotyping of the multiple functional polymorphisms introduced non-differential misclassification and biased the association toward the null. We used bias analysis to evaluate the plausibility of this explanation and to guide a decision about devoting study resources toward more comprehensive genotyping of other polymorphisms in the CYP2D6 gene. The second example examines the association between vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy and the incidence of 24 site-specific cancers, using heart valve replacement as an instrumental variable. Earlier studies suggested a protective association between VKA anticoagulants and the incidence of cancer. We observed a null-centered distribution of associations, which may be due to non-differential misclassification of VKA therapy by the instrument. We used bias analysis to evaluate whether this misclassification was likely to explain the null-centered distribution of associations and to guide decisions about conducting a more expensive validation study. In the first example, the bias analysis showed that new data collection would be required to resolve the uncertainty, whereas the second example showed that new data collection was unlikely to be a productive use of scarce study resources.},

  abstract = {Abstract Left or biventricular (BiV) pacing, or cardiac resynchronization therapy, was proposed nearly 10 years ago as an adjunctive treatment for patients with advanced heart failure (HF) complicated by discoordinate contraction due to intraventricular conduction delay. Since then, both short-term and a growing number of long-term clinical trials have reported on the mechanisms and short- and mid-term efficacy of this approach, with encouraging results. Therapy is implemented with novel pacing systems incorporating an endocardial lead to stimulate the lateral free wall via a cardiac vein, and often a right ventricular (RV) apex lead to provide BiV stimulation. A third atrial sensing lead monitors intrinsic rhythm and provides timing data to ensure ventricular pre-excitation. Modulation of the electronic atrial-ventricular (AV) time delay can optimize contractile synchrony, enhance the contribution of atrial systole, and reduce mitral regurgitation. Individuals with advanced HF, a wide QRS complex often with an AV time delay, and evidence of contraction dyssynchrony in viable myocardium represent the target patient group. Short-term studies reveal systolic augmentation and chamber efficiency from pacing resynchronization that can be substantial. Long-term studies reveal improved symptoms and exercise capacity, and some report reversal of chronic cardiac dilation. However, important questions regarding long-term efficacy and mortality impact, optimal mode for pacing stimulation, and role of combined pacing/cardioverter/defibrillation devices remain unresolved. Here we review pathophysiologic mechanisms, short- and long-term clinical results, and future directions of this new and promising therapy.},

  abstract = {Early detection of cardiac motion abnormalities is one of the main goals of quantitative cardiac image processing. This article presents a new method to compute the 2-D myocardial motion parameters from gray-scale 2-D echocardiographic sequences, making special emphasis on the validation of the proposed technique in comparison with Doppler tissue imaging. Myocardial motion is computed using a frame-to-frame nonrigid registration technique on the whole sequence. The key feature of our method is the use of an analytical representation of the myocardial displacement based on a semilocal parametric model of the deformation using Bsplines. Myocardial motion analysis is performed to obtain displacement, velocity and strain parameters. Robustness and speed are achieved by introducing a multiresolution optimization strategy. To validate the method, velocity measurements in three different regions-of-interest in the septum have been compared with those obtained with Doppler tissue velocity in healthy and pathologic subjects. Regression and Bland-Altman analysis show very good agreement between the two different approaches, with the great advantage that the new method overcomes the angle-dependency limitations of the Doppler techniques, providing both longitudinal and radial measurements.

  abstract = {Background\textemdash Response to cardiac resynchronization therapy depends both on dyssynchrony and (regional) contractility. We hypothesized that septal deformation can be used to infer integrated information on dyssynchrony and regional contractility, and thereby predict cardiac resynchronization therapy response. Methods and Results\textemdash In 132 cardiac resynchronization therapy candidates with left bundle branch block (LBBB)-like electrocardiogram morphology (left ventricular ejection fraction 19Ϯ6\%; QRS width 170Ϯ23 ms), longitudinal septal strain was assessed by speckle tracking echocardiography. To investigate the effects of dyssynchronous activation and differences in septal and left ventricular free wall contractility on septal deformation pattern, we used the CircAdapt computer model of the human heart and circulation. In the patients, 3 characteristic septal deformation patterns were identified: LBBB-1ϭdouble-peaked systolic shortening (nϭ28); LBBB-2ϭearly systolic shortening followed by prominent systolic stretching (nϭ34); and LBBB-3ϭpseudonormal shortening with less pronounced late systolic stretch (nϭ70). LBBB-3 revealed more scar (2 [2\textendash 5] segments) compared with LBBB-1 and LBBB-2 (both 0 [0 \textendash 1], PϽ0.05). In the model, imposing a time difference of activation between septum and left ventricular free wall resulted in pattern LBBB-1. This transformed into pattern LBBB-2 by additionally simulating septal hypocontractility, and into pattern LBBB-3 by imposing additional left ventricular free wall or global left ventricular hypocontractility. Improvement of left ventricular ejection fraction and reduction of left ventricular volumes after cardiac resynchronization therapy were most pronounced in LBBB-1 and worst in LBBB-3 patients. Conclusions\textemdash A double-peaked systolic septal deformation pattern is characteristic for LBBB and results from intraventricular dyssynchrony. Abnormal contractility modifies this pattern. A computer model can be helpful in understanding septal deformation and predicting cardiac resynchronization therapy response. (Circ Heart Fail. 2012; 5:87-96.)},

This article details a review of 67 publications in high-impact general clinical journals that considered the NRI. Incomplete reporting of NRI methods, incorrect calculation, and common misinterpretations were found. To aid improved applications of the NRI, the article elaborates on several aspects of the computation and interpretation in various settings. Limitations and controversies are discussed, including the effect of miscalibration of prediction models, the use of the continuous NRI and ``clinical NRI,'' and the relation with decision analytic measures. A systematic approach toward presenting NRI analysis is proposed: Detail and motivate the methods used for computation of the NRI, use clinically meaningful risk cutoffs for the category-based NRI, report both NRI components, address issues of calibration, and do not interpret the overall NRI as a percentage of the study population reclassified. Promising NRI findings need to be followed with decision analytic or formal cost-effectiveness evaluations.;},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Some studies have suggested that women respond differently to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). We sought to determine whether female gender influences long-term clinical outcome, symptomatic response as well as echocardiographic response after CRT. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 550 patients (age 70.4 {$\pm$} 10.7 yrs [mean {$\pm$} standard deviation]) were followed up for a maximum of 9.1 years (median: 36.2 months) after CRT-pacing (CRT-P) or CRT-defibrillation (CRT-D) device implantation. Outcome measure included mortality as well as unplanned hospitalizations for heart failure or major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Female gender predicted survival from cardiovascular death (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.52, P = 0.0051), death from any cause (HR: 0.52, P = 0.0022), the composite endpoints of cardiovascular death /heart failure hospitalizations (HR: 0.56, P = 0.0036) and death from any cause/hospitalizations for MACE (HR: 0.67, P = 0.0214). Female gender predicted death from pump failure (HR: 0.55, P = 0.0330) but not sudden cardiac death. Amongst the 322 patients with follow-up echocardiography, left ventricular (LV) reverse remodelling ({$\geq$} 15\% reduction in LV end-systolic volume) was more pronounced in women (62\% vs 44\%, P = 0.0051). In multivariable Cox proportional hazards analyses, the association between female gender and cardiovascular survival was independent of age, LV ejection fraction, atrial rhythm, QRS duration, CRT device type, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, and LV reverse remodelling (adjusted HR: 0.48, P = 0.0086). At one year, the symptomatic response rate (improvement by {$\geq$} 1 NYHA classes or {$\geq$} 25\% increase in walking distance) was 78\% for both women and men. CONCLUSIONS: Female gender is independently associated with a lower mortality and morbidity after CRT.},

Methods and results In an individual-patient data meta-analysis of five randomized controlled trials, all-cause mortality and the composite of all-cause mortality or first hospitalization for heart failure (HF) were compared among 794 women and 2702 men assigned to CRT or a control group. Multivariable analyses were performed to assess the impact of sex, QRS duration, HF aetiology, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD), and height on outcome. Women were shorter, had smaller LVEDD, more often left bundle branch block, and less often ischaemic heart disease, but QRS duration was similar between sexes. Women tended to obtain greater benefit from CRT but sex was not an independent predictor of either outcome. For all-cause mortality, QRS duration was the only independent predictor of CRT benefit. For the composite outcome, height and QRS duration, but not sex, were independent predictors of CRT benefit. Further analysis suggested increasing benefit with increasing QRS duration amongst shorter patients, of whom a great proportion were women. Conclusions In this individual-patient data meta-analysis, CRT benefit was greater in shorter patients, which may explain reports of enhanced CRT benefit among women. Further analyses are required to determine whether recommendations on the QRS threshold for CRT should be adjusted for height. (ClinicalTrials.gov numbers: NCT00170300, NCT00271154, NCT00251251).},

Forty-five normal subjects acted as controls. Systolic LV longitudinal strain (LS), systolic longitudinal strain rate (LSrS), early diastolic longitudinal strain rate (LSrE), and late diastolic longitudinal strain rate (LSrA) were measured using speckle tracking echocardiography. LV diastolic and systolic dyssynchrony (Te-SD and Ts-SD) were calculated. Results: Te-SD and Ts-SD were prolonged in HFpEF and HFrEF patients than in the control group (p{$<$}0.05). However, Ts-SD was shorter in HFpEF patients compared to HFrEF patients despite a narrow QRS complex (p{$<$}0.05). LV global LS, LSrS, and LSrE were decreased in patients with HFpEF and HFrEF compared to other groups, with HFrEF being even more reduced than HFpEF (p{$<$}0.05). Reduced LS, LSrS, and LSrE could effectively differentiate HF from asymptomatic LVDD patients (p{$<$}0.05). Conclusion: HFrEF exhibited increased systolic dyssynchrony compared to HFpEF despite a narrow QRS complex in addition to the more reduced diastolic and systolic function. Therefore, targeting to improve diastolic and systolic function instead of managing systolic dyssynchrony might be of great importance in the treatment of HFpEF.},

We compared clinical outcomes and echocardiographic changes after CRT implantation by LOR. Methods Consecutive CRT-defibrillator recipients with LBBB implanted between 2006 and 2015 at Duke University Medical Center were included (N = 496). Time to heart transplant, left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation, or death was compared among patients with LOR {$<$}12 vs {$\geq$}12 using Cox-proportional hazard models. Changes in LVEF and LV volumes after CRT were compared by LOR. Results Baseline ECG LOR {$<$}12 was associated with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.69 (95\% CI: 1.12-2.40, P = .01) for heart transplant, LVAD, or death. Patients with LOR {$<$}12 had less reduction of LV end diastolic volume ({$\Delta$}LVEDV -4 {$\pm$} 21 vs -13 {$\pm$} 23\%, P = .04) and LV end systolic volume ({$\Delta$}LVESV -9 {$\pm$} 27 vs -22 {$\pm$} 26\%, P = .03) after CRT. In patients with QRS duration (QRSd) {$\geq$}150 ms, LOR {$<$}12 was associated with an adjusted HR of 2.01 (95\% CI 1.21-3.35, P = .008) for heart transplant, LVAD, or death, compared with LOR {$\geq$}12. Conclusions Baseline ECG LOR {$<$}12 portends worse outcomes after CRT implantation in patients with LBBB, specifically among those with QRSd {$\geq$}150 ms. This ECG ratio may identify patients with a class I indication for CRT implantation at high risk for poor postimplantation outcomes.},

  abstract = {Introduction We evaluated the association between a novel electrocardiographic (ECG) marker of late, rightward electrocardiographic forces (termed the lead one ratio [LOR]), and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), myocardial scar, and clinical outcomes in patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB). Methods and Results LOR was calculated in patients with LBBB from a derivation cohort (n = 240) and receiver operator characteristic curves identified optimal threshold values for predicting myocardial scar and LVEF less than 35\%. An independent validation cohort of patients with LBBB (n = 196) was used to test the association of LOR with the myocardial scar, LVEF, and the likelihood of death, heart transplant or left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation. The optimal thresholds in the derivation cohort were LOR less than 13.7 for identification of scar (sensitivity 55\%, specificity 80\%), and LOR less than 12.1 for LVEF less than 35\% (sensitivity 49\%, specificity 80\%). In the validation cohort, LOR less than 13.7 was not associated with scar size or presence (P {$>$} 0.05 for both). LOR less than 12.1 was associated with lower LVEF (30 [20-40] versus 40 [25-55]\%; P = 0.002) and predicted LVEF less than 35\% in univariable (odds ratio [OR], 2.2 [1.2-4.1]; P = 0.01) and multivariable analysis (OR, 2.2 [1.2-4.3]; P = 0.02). LOR less than 12.1 was associated with scar presence when patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy were excluded (OR = 7.2 [1.5-33.2]; P = 0.002). LOR less than 12.1 had an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.53 ([1.05-2.21]; P = 0.03) for death, transplant or LVAD implantation. Conclusions In conclusion, ECG LOR less than 12.1 predicts reduced-LV systolic function and poorer prognosis in patients with LBBB.},

Background Nonischemic patterns of LGE with normal LV volumes and ejection fraction are increasingly detected on cardiovascular magnetic resonance, but their prognostic significance, and consequently management, is uncertain. Methods Patients with midwall/subepicardial LGE and normal LV volumes, wall thickness, and ejection fraction on cardiovascular magnetic resonance were enrolled and compared to a control group without LGE. The primary outcome was actual or aborted sudden cardiac death (SCD). Results Of 748 patients enrolled, 401 had LGE and 347 did not. The median age was 50~years (interquartile range: 38-61 years), LV ejection fraction 66\% (interquartile range: 62\%-70\%), and 287 (38\%) were women. Scan indications included chest pain (40\%), palpitation (33\%) and breathlessness (13\%). No patient experienced SCD and only 1 LGE+ patient (0.13\%) had an aborted SCD in the 11th follow-up year. Over a median of 4.3 years, 30 patients (4.0\%) died. All-cause mortality was similar for LGE+/- patients (3.7\% vs 4.3\%; P = 0.71) and was associated with age (HR: 2.04 per 10 years; 95\% CI: 1.46-2.79; P~{$<$} 0.001). Twenty-one LGE+ and 4 LGE- patients had an unplanned cardiovascular hospital admission (HR: 7.22; 95\% CI: 4.26-21.17; P~{$<$} 0.0001). Conclusions There was a low SCD risk during long-term follow-up in patients with LGE but otherwise normal LV volumes and ejection fraction. Mortality was driven by age and not LGE presence, location, or extent, although the latter was associated with greater cardiovascular hospitalization for suspected myocarditis and symptomatic ventricular tachycardia.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To investigate the diagnostic value of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) feature-tracking (FT) myocardial strain analysis in patients with suspected acute myocarditis and its association with myocardial oedema. METHODS: Forty-eight patients with suspected acute myocarditis and 35 control subjects underwent CMR. FT CMR analysis of systolic longitudinal (LS), circumferential (CS) and radial strain (RS) was performed. Additionally, the protocol allowed for the assessment of T1 and T2 relaxation times. RESULTS: When compared with healthy controls, myocarditis patients demonstrated reduced LS, CS and RS values (LS: -19.5 +/- 4.4\% vs. -23.6 +/- 3.1\%, CS: -23.0 +/- 5.8\% vs. -27.4 +/- 3.4\%, RS: 28.9 +/- 8.5\% vs. 32.4 +/- 7.4\%; P {$<$} 0.05, respectively). LS (T1: r = 0.462, P {$<$} 0.001; T2: r = 0.436, P {$<$} 0.001) and CS (T1: r = 0.429, P {$<$} 0.001; T2: r = 0.467, P {$<$} 0.001) showed the strongest correlations with T1 and T2 relaxations times. Area under the curve of LS (0.79) was higher compared with those of CS (0.75; P = 0.478) and RS (0.62; P = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: FT CMR myocardial strain analysis might serve as a new tool for assessment of myocardial dysfunction in the diagnostic work-up of patients suspected of having acute myocarditis. Especially, LS and CS show a sufficient diagnostic performance and were most closely correlated with CMR parameters of myocardial oedema. KEY POINTS: * Myocardial strain measures are considerably reduced in patients with suspected myocarditis. * Myocardial strain measures can sufficiently discriminate between diseased and healthy patients. * Myocardial strain measures show basic associations with the extent of myocardial oedema/inflammation.},

  abstract = {Background\textemdash Left ventricular (LV) mechanical discoordination, often referred to as dyssynchrony, is often observed in patients with heart failure regardless of QRS duration. We hypothesized that different myocardial substrates for LV mechanical discoordination exist from (1) electromechanical activation delay, (2) regional differences in contractility, or (3) regional scar and that we could differentiate electromechanical substrates responsive to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) from unresponsive non\textendash electrical substrates. Methods and Results\textemdash First, we used computer simulations to characterize mechanical discoordination patterns arising from electromechanical and non\textendash electrical substrates and accordingly devise the novel systolic stretch index (SSI), as the sum of posterolateral systolic prestretch and septal systolic rebound stretch. Second, 191 patients with heart failure (QRS duration {$\geq$}120 ms; LV ejection fraction {$\leq$}35\%) had baseline SSI quantified by automated echocardiographic radial strain analysis. Patients with SSI{$\geq$}9.7\% had significantly less heart failure hospitalizations or deaths 2 years after CRT (hazard ratio, 0.32; 95\% confidence interval, 0.19\textendash 0.53; P{$<$}0.001) and less deaths, transplants, or LV assist devices (hazard ratio, 0.28; 95\% confidence interval, 0.15\textendash 0.55; P{$<$}0.001). Furthermore, in a subgroup of 113 patients with intermediate electrocardiographic criteria (QRS duration of 120\textendash 149 ms or non\textendash left bundle branch block), SSI{$\geq$}9.7\% was independently associated with significantly less heart failure hospitalizations or deaths (hazard ratio, 0.41; 95\% confidence interval, 0.23\textendash 0.79; P=0.004) and less deaths, transplants, or LV assist devices (hazard ratio, 0.27; 95\% confidence interval, 0.12\textendash 0.60; P=0.001). Conclusions\textemdash Computer simulations differentiated patterns of LV mechanical discoordination caused by electromechanical substrates responsive to CRT from those related to regional hypocontractility or scar unresponsive to CRT. The novel SSI identified patients who benefited more favorably from CRT, including those with intermediate electrocardiographic criteria, where CRT response is less certain by ECG alone.},

MEASURES Prevalence, mortality, frequency of AFD manifestations, and impact of disease on patient lives, assessed from the AFD register and the disease specific questionnaire. RESULTS The median cumulative survival was 50 years (n=51), which represents an approximately 20 year reduction of life span. Neuropathic pain was present in 77\% (n=93) with mean pain score of 5 (scale 0\textendash 10) despite treatment with anticonvulsants and opiates. Pain stopped in only 11\%. Cerebrovascular complications developed in 24.2\% and renal failure in 30\%. The onset and progression of serious AFD manifestations was highly variable. The relationship of gastrointestinal manifestations on weight, using body mass index (BMI), was significant (p=0.01). High frequency sensorineural deafness was confirmed in 78\% of audiograms. Neuropathic pain and angiokeratoma were absent in five adult males ({$\sim$}5\%). Median age at diagnosis of AFD was 21.9 years (n=64). IMPACT OF DISEASE Attendance at school, sports, and social activity were significantly affected by AFD. Only 56.6\% (n=46) of patients were employed. Psychosexual effects of genital angiokeratoma, genital pain, and impotence were not previously recognised. CONCLUSION The majority of males experience multiple disease manifestations and the duration of neuropathic pain was lifelong. The AFD register proved useful for the determination of baseline disease parameters in this cohort.},

  abstract = {Editor\textemdash Anderson-Fabry disease (AFD) is a sphingolipid storage disorder resulting from the deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme {$\alpha$}-galactosidase. Unlike most other lysosomal diseases, the inheritance is X linked. Disease manifestations in female heterozygotes have been reported, but are considered to be rare and usually mild.1 Asymptomatic corneal dystrophy (cornea verticillata and posterior lenticular cataract) is present in about 70\% and is useful for heterozygote detection. About 30\% of women have minimal angiokeratomas and {$<$}10\% have infrequent attacks of neuropathic pains.1 However, female heterozygotes with severe and early cerebrovascular disease, strokes, and renal failure have been documented, but these serious manifestations were estimated to occur in only 1\%.1 Because this is an X linked disorder, these severe manifestations in females were explained by skewed X inactivation.2  Case reports are open to selection bias and there are no reported data on the frequency and severity of AFD manifestations in a large cohort of carriers. Women are not usually evaluated in the clinic unless they present with serious AFD complications, but they do attend for genetic counselling when their son or male relative is diagnosed with the disease. During regular reviews of AFD families in the genetic clinic, we have observed multiple and more frequent AFD manifestations in female carriers than expected. Owing to the lack of clinical data and present health care policy, we were unable to perform clinical investigations. Therefore, a large cohort study using an AFD specific questionnaire was performed to establish the mortality and the frequency of all AFD manifestations in obligate carrier females. All known (n=80) obligate carrier females, who were over the age of 18 and had demographic data recorded in the AFD register, were asked to participate in this study.

Background Current STI-based strain measurements are highly automated. It remains unclear when a particular analysis software defines the zero baseline and the systolic strain measurement position. Methods A total of 60 subjects (20 healthy volunteers, 20 patients with coronary artery disease, and 20 patients with typical left bundle-branch block) underwent a complete echocardiographic examination. In one-half of them, a real M-mode through the mitral valve was acquired for each electrocardiographic (ECG) lead of the echo machine. Timing of peak R and automatic ECG trigger were~compared with mitral valve closure for every electrode. Mitral and aortic valve closure, as observed in the apical 3-chamber view, served as reference for ED and ES. With the use of these references, end-systolic global longitudinal strain (ES-GLS) and end-systolic segmental longitudinal strain (ES-SLS) longitudinal end-systolic strain were measured at baseline and after changing the definition of either ED or~ES~by {$\pm$}4 frames. Furthermore, strain and volume curves derived from the same tracking, as well as the Doppler interrogation of the valves, were compared with the references. Results Depending on the selected lead, timing of the ECG-derived time markers changed considerably compared with mitral valve closure. Changing the definition of ED and ES resulted in significantly different ES-GLS and ES-SLS values in all subjects. ES-SLS in dyssynchronous hearts showed the highest sensitivity to timing definition. From all methods, spectral Doppler was the most reliable time marker in all subjects (p {$>$} 0.05). Conclusions Exact temporal definition of ED and ES has a major impact on the accuracy of strain measurements. After direct observation of the valves, Doppler evaluation is the best means for characterizing ED and ES for STI analysis.},

Background Targeting the LV lead to the region of latest electrical activation or the segment of latest peak contraction has both been shown to improve CRT response. Whether these regions correspond within CRT patients is~uncertain. Methods Twenty-eight consecutive CRT candidates underwent intraprocedural coronary venous electroanatomic mapping using EnSite NavX. Peak contraction time of the mapped LV regions was determined using longitudinal strain derived from speckle tracking echocardiography. Electrical activation and peak contraction times were correlated on a per patient basis, and the regions of latest electrical activation and latest peak contraction were compared. Results Successful measurements by both techniques allowed analysis in 23 of 28 patients. There was a strong positive correlation between electrical activation and peak contraction times within each patient (R2~= 0.85 {$\pm$} 0.09). However, the magnitude of the electrical activation\textendash peak contraction relationship varied greatly among patients (slope of regression line: 4.05 {$\pm$} 3.23). The regions of latest electrical activation and latest peak contraction corresponded in 19 of 23 (83\%) patients and were adjacent in 4 patients. Conclusions There is a close relationship between the timing of LV electrical activation and peak contraction in~CRT~candidates.

  abstract = {In this paper, the current status of cardiac image registration methods is reviewed. The combination of information from multiple cardiac image modalities, such as magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, positron emission tomography, single-photon emission computed tomography, and ultrasound, is of increasing interest in the medical community for physiologic understanding and diagnostic purposes. Registration of cardiac images is a more complex problem than brain image registration because the heart is a nonrigid moving organ inside a moving body. Moreover, as compared to the registration of brain images, the heart exhibits much fewer accurate anatomical landmarks. In a clinical context, physicians often mentally integrate image information from different modalities. Automatic registration, based on computer programs, might, however, offer better accuracy and repeatability and save time.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}\emph{P}values and hypothesis testing methods are frequently misused in clinical research. Much of this misuse appears to be owing to the widespread, mistaken belief that they provide simple, reliable, and objective triage tools for separating the true and important from the untrue or unimportant. The primary focus in interpreting therapeutic clinical research data should be on the treatment (``oomph'') effect, a metaphorical force that moves patients given an effective treatment to a different clinical state relative to their control counterparts. This effect is assessed using 2 complementary types of statistical measures calculated from the data, namely, effect magnitude or size and precision of the effect size. In a randomized trial, effect size is often summarized using constructs, such as odds ratios, hazard ratios, relative risks, or adverse event rate differences. How large a treatment effect has to be to be consequential is a matter for clinical judgment. The precision of the effect size (conceptually related to the amount of spread in the data) is usually addressed with confidence intervals.\emph{P}values (significance tests) were first proposed as an informal heuristic to help assess how ``unexpected'' the observed effect size was if the true state of nature was no effect or no difference. Hypothesis testing was a modification of the significance test approach that envisioned controlling the false-positive rate of study results over many (hypothetical) repetitions of the experiment of interest. Both can be helpful but, by themselves, provide only a tunnel vision perspective on study results that ignores the clinical effects the study was conducted to measure.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Background: Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) has proved to be very effective in improving morbidity and mortality in patients affected with severe congestive heart failure. Its efficacy has been shown to be greater in patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB). The aim of our study was to verify if newly proposed criteria for true LBBB identify patients with a better clinical and instrumental response to CRT. Methods: Between May 2007 and April 2011, 111 patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) {$\leq$} 35\% and LBBB morphology received a CRT device and were divided into two groups according to QRS morphology. Group 1 (61 patients) consisted of patients with ``true'' LBBB morphology; group 2 (50 patients) consisted of patients with ``false'' LBBB. The primary endpoint was the utility of criteria for true LBBB to predict a composite endpoint of all-cause mortality and hospital admission with heart failure. The secondary endpoint was the utility of the same criteria to predict an absolute increase in LVEF {$\geq$} 10\%. Results: ``False'' LBBB morphology and a dose of bisoprolol {$<$}5 mg at last follow-up were the only parameters related to clinical outcome in multivariate analysis (respectively: hazard ratio [HR] 3.98, confidence interval [CI] 95\% 1.51\textendash 10.48; HR 0.15, CI 95\% 0.05\textendash 0.43). ``True'' LBBB morphology was the only variable significantly related to a greater increase in LVEF (HR 4.57, CI 95\% 1.36\textendash 8.28). Conclusion: True LBBB morphology is related to a higher event-free survival rate in CRT patients and better echocardiographic response. (PACE 2012; 35:927\textendash 934)},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that the presence of left bundle branch block (LBBB) is associated with an increased risk of cardiac mortality and heart failure (HF). Recently, new criteria to define strict LBBB have been proposed: QRS duration {$\geq$}140 ms for men and {$\geq$}130 ms for women, along with mid-QRS notching or slurring in {$\geq$}2 contiguous leads. HYPOTHESIS: We assessed the prevalence and prognostic significance of LBBB according to classical (QRS duration {$\geq$}120ms) and strict criteria in permanent pacemaker patients. METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled 723 consecutive patients who had undergone single- or dual-chamber pacemaker implantation at the study center from July 2002 to December 2014. Patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction {$\leq$}35\% or a prior diagnosis of HF were excluded. RESULTS: LBBB was reported in 54 (7\%) patients, and strict-LBBB in 15 (2\%) patients. During a median follow-up of 48 months (range, 18-92 months), 147 (20\%) patients reached the combined endpoint of death or HF hospitalization. Patients with LBBB and those with strict-LBBB displayed significantly higher rates of death or HF hospitalization (log-rank test, all P {$<$} 0.0001). In particular, strict-LBBB was associated with the worst outcome. The presence of LBBB according to classical definition criteria (hazard ratio [HR]\,=\,1.98, confidence interval [CI]: 1.23-3.19, P = 0.005) and to strict criteria (HR = 2.20; CI: 1.04-4.65; P = 0.039) were both confirmed as independent predictors of death or HF hospitalization after adjustment for relevant clinical covariates. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients who had undergone standard pacemaker implantation, the prevalence of LBBB was 7\% according to classical definition criteria and 2\% according to strict criteria. The presence of LBBB, and particularly of strict-LBBB, at the baseline predicted a poor outcome in terms of death or HF hospitalization.},

  abstract = {Background:Impaired myocardial conduction is the underlying mechanism for re-entrant arrhythmias. Carbon nanotube fibers (CNTfs) combine the mechanical properties of suture materials with the conductive properties of metals and may form a restorative solution to impaired myocardial conduction.Methods:Acute open chest electrophysiology studies were performed in sheep (n=3). Radiofrequency ablation was used to create epicardial conduction delay after which CNTf and then silk suture controls were applied. CNTfs were surgically sewn across the right atrioventricular junction in rodents, and acute (n=3) and chronic (4-week, n=6) electrophysiology studies were performed. Rodent toxicity studies (n=10) were performed. Electrical analysis of the CNTf-myocardial interface was performed.Results:In all cases, the large animal studies demonstrated improvement in conduction velocity using CNTf. The acute rodent model demonstrated ventricular preexcitation during sinus rhythm. All chronic cases demonstrated resumption of atrioventricular conduction, but these required atrial pacing. There was no gross or histopathologic evidence of toxicity. Ex vivo studies demonstrated contact impedance significantly lower than platinum iridium.Conclusions:Here, we show that in sheep, CNTfs sewn across epicardial scar acutely improve conduction. In addition, CNTf maintain conduction for 1 month after atrioventricular nodal ablation in the absence of inflammatory or toxic responses in rats but only in the paced condition. The CNTf/myocardial interface has such low impedance that CNTf can facilitate local, downstream myocardial activation. CNTf are conductive, biocompatible materials that restore electrical conduction in diseased myocardium, offering potential long-term restorative solutions in pathologies interrupting efficient electrical transduction in electrically excitable tissues.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: We analysed 5-year treatment with agalsidase alfa enzyme replacement therapy in patients with Fabry's disease who were enrolled in the Fabry Outcome Survey observational database (FOS). METHODS: Baseline and 5-year data were available for up to 181 adults (126 men) in FOS. Serial data for cardiac mass and function, renal function, pain, and quality of life were assessed. Safety and sensitivity analyses were done in patients with baseline and at least one relevant follow-up measurement during the 5 years (n=555 and n=475, respectively). FINDINGS: In patients with baseline cardiac hypertrophy, treatment resulted in a sustained reduction in left ventricular mass (LVM) index after 5 years (from 71.4 [SD 22.5] g/m(2.7) to 64.1 [18.7] g/m(2.7), p=0.0111) and a significant increase in midwall fractional shortening (MFS) from 14.3\% (2.3) to 16.0\% (3.8) after 3 years (p=0.02). In patients without baseline hypertrophy, LVM index and MFS remained stable. Mean yearly fall in estimated glomerular filtration rate versus baseline after 5 years of enzyme replacement therapy was -3.17 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) for men and -0.89 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) for women. Average pain, measured by Brief Pain Inventory score, improved significantly, from 3.7 (2.3) at baseline to 2.5 (2.4) after 5 years (p=0.0023). Quality of life, measured by deviation scores from normal EuroQol values, improved significantly, from -0.24 (0.3) at baseline to -0.17 (0.3) after 5 years (p=0.0483). Findings were confirmed by sensitivity analysis. No unexpected safety concerns were identified. INTERPRETATION: By comparison with historical natural history data for patients with Fabry's disease who were not treated with enzyme replacement therapy, long-term treatment with agalsidase alfa leads to substantial and sustained clinical benefits.

  abstract = {Background Fabry disease is a rare X-linked disorder caused by deficient activity of the lysosomal enzyme {$\alpha$}-galactosidase A. Progressive accumulation of the substrate globotriaosylceramide in cells throughout the body leads to major organ failure and premature death. In response to the recent introduction of enzyme replacement therapy, the Fabry Outcome Survey (FOS) was established to pool data from European clinics on the natural history of this little-known disease and to monitor the long-term efficacy and safety of treatment. This paper presents the first analysis of the FOS database and provides essential baseline data against which the effects of enzyme replacement can be measured. Design Baseline data from a cohort of 366 patients from 11 European countries were analysed in terms of demography and clinical manifestations of Fabry disease. Results Misdiagnosis of Fabry disease is common, and the mean delay from onset of symptoms to correct diagnosis was 13{$\cdot$}7 and 16{$\cdot$}3 years in males and females, respectively. Although previously thought to have serious manifestations only in hemizygous men, the FOS database has confirmed that females heterozygous for Fabry disease are similarly affected. Furthermore, signs and symptoms of Fabry disease may be present from early childhood. Conclusions With the advent of enzyme replacement therapy, it is important that general practitioners and physicians in a range of specialties recognize the signs and symptoms of Fabry disease so that effective treatment can be given. Baseline data from FOS demonstrate that enzyme replacement therapy should not be restricted to hemizygous men, but should be considered for both heterozygous females and children.},

  abstract = {Background: Fabry disease is a rare X-linked lysosomal storage disorder characterised by severe multisystemic involvement that leads to major organ failure and premature death in affected men and women. Over the past 7 years, the Fabry Outcome Survey (FOS) has collected data on the natural history of Fabry disease, and the long-term efficacy and safety of enzyme-replacement therapy. This paper provides an update on the first analysis of FOS data. Design: Baseline data on clinical manifestations and causes of death in a cohort of 1453 patients (699 male, 754 female) from 19 countries worldwide were analysed. Causes of death of affected relatives were analysed separately. Results: The most frequently reported signs and symptoms of Fabry disease were neurological. Cardiac, ocular, gastrointestinal, dermatological, auditory and renal manifestations were also common. The principal causes of death among 181 affected relatives of patients in FOS (most of whom had died before 2001) were renal failure in males (42\%) and cerebrovascular disease in females (25\%). In contrast, of the 42 patients enrolled in FOS whose deaths were reported between 2001 and 2007, cardiac disease was the main cause of death in both male (34\%) and female (57\%) patients. Conclusion: These data suggest that the importance of renal disease as a cause of death in patients with Fabry disease is decreasing while the importance of cardiac disease is increasing. This pattern probably reflects improvements in the management of renal disease in patients with Fabry disease.},

  abstract = {Background Previous studies have found a high frequency of mechanical dyssynchrony in patients with heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), hence suggesting that cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) may be considered in HFpEF. The present study was designed to compare the amount of mechanical dyssynchrony between HFpEF patients and (1) HF with reduced EF (HFrEF) patients with an indication for CRT (HFrEF-CRT(+)) group, (2) HFrEF patients with QRS duration b120 ms (HFrEF-QRS b120 ms) group, and (3) hypertensive controls (HTN). Methods Electrical (ECG) and mechanical dyssynchrony (atrio-ventricular dyssynchrony, interventricular dyssynchrony, intraventricular dyssynchrony) were assessed using conventional, tissue Doppler, and Speckle Tracking strain echocardiography in 40 HFpEF patients, 40 age- and sex-matched HTN controls, 40 HFrEF-QRS b120 ms patients, and 40 HFrEF-CRT(+) patients. Results The frequency of left bundle branch block was low in HFpEF patients (5\%) and similar to HTN controls (5\%, P = 0.85). Indices of dyssynchrony were similar between HFpEF and HTN patients or HFrEF-QRS b120 ms patients. In contrast, most indices of dyssynchrony differed between HFpEF and HFrEF-CRT(+) patients. The principal components analysis on the entire cohort of 160 patients yielded 2 homogeneous groups of patients in terms of dyssynchrony, the first comprising HFrEF-CRT(+) patients and the second comprising HTN, HFrEF-QRS b120 ms and HFpEF patients. Conclusions Mechanical dyssynchrony in HFpEF does not differ from that of patients with HTN or patients with HFrEF and a narrow QRS. This data raises concerns regarding the role of dyssynchrony in the pathophysiology of HFpEF and thereby the potential usage of CRT in HFpEF. (Am Heart J 2014;168:909-916.e1.)},

However, there has been limited success in deriving estimates for the full posterior distribution of regression coefficients in these models, due to a need to evaluate analytically intractable partition function integrals. Here, the Fourier transform is used to express these integrals as complex-valued oscillatory integrals over "regression frequencies". This results in an analytic expansion and stationary phase approximation for the partition functions of the Bayesian lasso and elastic net, where the non-differentiability of the double-exponential prior has so far eluded such an approach. Use of this approximation leads to highly accurate numerical estimates for the expectation values and marginal posterior distributions of the regression coefficients, and allows for Bayesian inference of much higher dimensional models than previously possible.},

Current Doppler echocardiography guidelines recommend using early to late diastolic transmitral flow velocity (E/A) to assess diastolic function, and E to early diastolic mitral annular tissue velocity (E/e') to estimate LV filling pressures. Although both parameters have important diagnostic and prognostic implications, they should be interpreted in the context of a patient's age and the rest of the echocardiogram to describe diastolic function and guide patient management.

Methods and Results\textemdash Of 184 heart failure patients with anticipated CRT who were prospectively enrolled, 131 patients with wide QRS and LVEF \&lt; 35\% had 6-month follow-up after CRT implantation. Fourteen dyssynchrony indices (feasibility) by M-mode (94\%), tissue velocity (96\%), tissue Doppler strain (92\%), 2D speckle strain (65-86\%), 3-D echocardiography (79\%), and timing intervals (98\%) were evaluated. Reverse remodeling (RR: end-systolic volume (ESV) reduction {$\geq$} 15\%) occurred in 55\% and more frequently in non-ischemics (71\%) than ischemics (42\%, p=0.002). Overall, only M-mode, tissue Doppler strain, and total isovolumic time (IVT) had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) greater than the line of no information, but none of these were strongly predictive of RR (AUC 0.63 - 0.71). In non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, no dyssynchrony index predicted RR. In ischemic cardiomyopathy, M-mode (AUC=0.67), tissue Doppler strain (AUC=0.79) and IVT (AUC= 0.76) derived indices predicted RR (p\&lt;0.05 for all) although the incremental value was modest. No indices predicted clinical response assessed by Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire, six-minute walk, and peak VO2. Conclusions\textemdash These findings are consistent with the Predictors of Response to CRT (PROSPECT) study and do not support use of these dyssynchrony indices to guide use of CRT.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To compare cardiovascular magnetic resonance-feature tracking (CMR-FT) with spatial modulation of magnetization (SPAMM) tagged imaging for the calculation of short and long axis Lagrangian strain measures in systole and diastole. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Healthy controls (n = 35) and patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 10) were identified prospectively and underwent steady-state free precession (SSFP) cine imaging and SPAMM imaging using a gradient-echo sequence. A timed offline analysis of images acquired at identical horizontal long and short axis slice positions was performed using CMR-FT and dynamic tissue-tagging (CIMTag2D). Agreement between strain and strain rate (SR) values calculated using these two different methods was assessed using the Bland-Altman technique. RESULTS: Across all participants, there was good agreement between CMR-FT and CIMTag for calculation of peak systolic global circumferential strain (-22.7 +/- 6.2\% vs. -22.5 +/- 6.9\%, bias 0.2 +/- 4.0\%) and SR (-1.35 +/- 0.42 1/s vs. -1.22 +/- 0.42 1/s, bias 0.13 +/- 0.33 1/s) and early diastolic global circumferential SR (1.21 +/- 0.44 1/s vs. 1.07 +/- 0.30 1/s, bias -0.14 +/- 0.34 1/s) at the subendocardium. There was satisfactory agreement for derivation of peak systolic global longitudinal strain (-18.1 +/- 5.0\% vs. -16.7 +/- 4.8\%, bias 1.3 +/- 3.8\%) and SR (-1.04 +/- 0.29 1/s vs. -0.95 +/- 0.32 1/s, bias 0.09 +/- 0.26 1/s). The weakest agreement was for early diastolic global longitudinal SR (1.10 +/- 0.40 1/s vs. 0.67 +/- 0.32 1/s, bias -0.42 +/- 0.40 1/s), although the correlation remained significant (r = 0.42, P {$<$} 0.01). CMR-FT generated these data over four times quicker than CIMTag. CONCLUSION: There is sufficient agreement between systolic and diastolic strain measures calculated using CMR-FT and myocardial tagging for CMR-FT to be considered as a potentially feasible and rapid alternative.},

Most software automatically exclude subjects with missing values. This commonly causes bias because missing values seldom occur completely at random (MCAR) but rather selectively based on other (observed) variables, missing at random (MAR). Multiple imputation (MI) of missing predictor values using all observed information including outcome is advocated to deal with selective missing values. This seems a self-fulfilling prophecy. Methods We tested this hypothesis using data from a study on diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. We selected five predictors of pulmonary embolism without missing values. Their regression coefficients and standard errors (SEs) estimated from the original sample were considered as ``true'' values. We assigned missing values to these predictors\textemdash both MCAR and MAR\textemdash and repeated this 1,000 times using simulations. Per simulation we multiple imputed the missing values without and with the outcome, and compared the regression coefficients and SEs to the truth. Results Regression coefficients based on MI including outcome were close to the truth. MI without outcome yielded very biased\textemdash underestimated\textemdash coefficients. SEs and coverage of the 90\% confidence intervals were not different between MI with and without outcome. Results were the same for MCAR and MAR.

  abstract = {Background Insufficient correction of mechanical dyssynchrony is a cause of non-response to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). Aims To determine if CRT delivery could be optimized during the implantation procedure by choosing the number and location of pacing sites using echocardiography guidance. Methods In patients with a QRS{$\geq$}150ms or a QRS{$<$}150ms and criteria for mechanical dyssynchrony, the objective of the implantation procedure was to shorten the left pre-ejection interval (LPEI), measured online, by at least 10ms compared with standard biventricular configuration, by moving the right ventricular (RV) lead at different locations and, if necessary, by adding a second RV lead. Results Ninety-one patients (70 men; mean age 73{$\pm$}10 years; left ventricular [LV] ejection fraction 29{$\pm$}10\%) were included. The final pacing configuration was standard biventricular in 15 (17\%) patients, optimized biventricular in 22 (24\%) and triple-site ventricular in 54 (59\%). LPEI was shortened by {$\geq$} 10ms compared with standard biventricular stimulation in 73 (80\%) patients. Compared with standard biventricular pacing, the final optimized pacing configuration improved global intraventricular synchrony (decreasing LPEI from 158{$\pm$}36ms to 134{$\pm$}29ms; P{$<$}0.001), LV systolic efficiency (decreasing LPEI/LV ejection time from 0.58{$\pm$}0.18 to 0.46{$\pm$}0.13; P{$<$}0.001) and LV filling (increasing LV filling time/RR from 44{$\pm$}8\% to 47{$\pm$}7\%; P{$<$}0.001) and decreased mitral valve regurgitation. Conclusion Intraoperative echocardiography-guided placement of RV lead(s) during CRT implantation is feasible and acutely improves LV synchrony compared with standard biventricular stimulation.

Whilst LV ejection fraction is frequently normal in both, LV strain assessment could differentiate between the diseases. We sought to establish if cardiovascular magnetic resonance myocardial feature tracking (CMR-FT), an emerging method allowing accurate assessment of myocardial deformation, differentiates between both diseases. Additionally, CMR assessment of fibrosis and LV hypertrophy allowed association analyses and comparison of diagnostic capacities. Methods Two-hundred twenty-four consecutive subjects (53 HHD, 107 HCM, and 64 controls) underwent 1.5T CMR including native myocardial T1 mapping and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE). Global longitudinal strain (GLS) was assessed by CMR-FT (CVi42, Circle Cardiovascular Imaging Inc.). Results GLS was significantly higher in HCM patients (-14.7{$\pm$}3.8 vs. -16.5{$\pm$}3.3\% [HHD], P = 0.004; or vs. -17.2{$\pm$}2.0\% [controls], P{$<$}0.001). GLS was associated with LV mass index (HHD, R = 0.419, P = 0.002; HCM, R = 0.429, P{$<$}0.001), and LV ejection fraction (HHD, R = -0.493, P = 0.002; HCM, R = -0.329, P{$<$}0.001). In HCM patients, GLS was also associated with global native T1 (R = 0.282, P = 0.003), and LGE volume ({$\rho$} = 0.380, P{$<$}0.001). Discrimination between HHD and HCM by GLS (c = 0.639, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.550\textendash 0.729) was similar to LV mass index (c = 0.643, 95\% CI 0.556\textendash 0.731), global myocardial native T1 (c = 0.718, 95\% CI 0.638\textendash 0.799), and LGE volume (c = 0.680, 95\% CI 0.585\textendash 0.775). Conclusion CMR-FT GLS differentiates between HHD and HCM. In HCM patients GLS is associated with myocardial fibrosis. The discriminatory capacity of CMR-FT GLS is similar to LV hypertrophy and fibrosis imaging markers.},

We tested predictors of systolic responsiveness on the basis of global parameters as well as directly assessed mechanical dyssynchrony. Methods and Results\textemdash Twenty-two DCM patients with conduction delay were studied by cardiac catheterization with a dual-sensor micromanometer to measure LV and aortic pressures during sinus rhythm and LV free-wall pacing. Pacing enhanced isovolumetric (dP/dtmax) and ejection-phase (pulse pressure, PP) systolic function by 35{$\pm$}21\% and 16.4{$\pm$}11\%, respectively, and these changes correlated directly (r=0.7, P=0.001). \%{$\Delta$}dP/dtmax was weakly predicted by baseline QRS (r=0.6, P{$<$}0.02), more strongly by baseline dP/dtmax (r=0.7, P=0.001), and best by bidiscriminate analysis combining baseline dP/dtmax {$\leq$}700 mm Hg/s and QRS {$\geq$}155 ms to predict \%{$\Delta$}dP/dtmax {$\geq$}25\% and \%{$\Delta$}PP {$\geq$}10\% (P{$<$}0.0005, {$\chi$}2), with no false-positives. Benefit could not be predicted by \%{$\Delta$}QRS. To test whether basal mechanical dyssynchrony predicted responsiveness to LV pacing, circumferential strains were determined at {$\approx$}80 sites throughout the LV by tagged MRI in 8 DCM patients and 7 additional control subjects. Strain variance at time of maximal shortening indexed dyssynchrony, averaging 28.0{$\pm$}7.1\% in normal subjects versus 201.4{$\pm$}84.3\% in DCM patients (P=0.001). Mechanical dyssynchrony also correlated directly with \%{$\Delta$}dP/dtmax (r=0.85, P=0.008). Conclusions\textemdash These results show that although mechanical dyssynchrony is a key predictor for pacing efficacy in DCM patients with conduction delay, combining information about QRS and basal dP/dtmax provides an excellent tool to identify maximal responders.},

Background CRT has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in selected patients with systolic heart failure. Cardiology societies provide guidelines regarding the indications for CRT. As evidence evolves, it is challenging for the guideline committees to review the impact of newer evidence in a timely fashion. Methods Six of the most recent international guidelines providing recommendation concerning CRT implantation ranging from 2011 to 2017 were reviewed. These included guidelines from 2 European, 1 North American, 1 Canadian, and 1 Australian/New Zealand societies and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines, specific to the United Kingdom. Results Although international societies provide consistent recommendations for most CRT indications, differences are found in recommendations for several important patient populations. Specifically, divergent recommendations exist regarding QRS duration, bundle branch morphology, patients in atrial fibrillation, choice of device type (CRT pacemakers vs. CRT defibrillators), and selected patients who are likely to be dependent on right ventricular pacing. The timing of publication of specific guidelines appears to play an essential role in explaining these disparities. Conclusions Despite general consistency in international guideline recommendations, there remain certain patient populations for whom there are variations in recommendations concerning eligibility for CRT and selection of the most appropriate device in the individual patient.},

The performance of the models was then evaluated using an independent external validation data set. We investigated both fully specified models and models derived using variable selection. Results Our results indicated that an EPV rule of thumb should be data driven and that EPV {$\geq$} 20 \hspace{0pt} generally eliminates bias in regression coefficients when many low-prevalence predictors are included in a Cox model.

  abstract = {Background: Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) improves outcome in patients with heart failure (HF) however approximately 30\% of patients still remain non-responsive. We propose a novel index\textemdash Regional Strain Pattern Index (RSPI)\textemdash to prospectively evaluate response to CRT. Methods: Echocardiography was performed in 49 patients with HF (66.5 {$\pm$} 10 years, LVEF 24.9 {$\pm$} 6.4\%, QRS width 173.1 {$\pm$} 19.1 ms) two times: before CRT implantation and 15 {$\pm$} 7 months after. At baseline, dyssynchrony was assessed including RSPI and strain pattern. RSPI was calculated from all three apical views across 12 segments as the sum of dyssynchronous components. From every apical view, presence of four components were assessed: (1) contraction of the early-activated wall; (2) prestretching of the late activated wall; (3) contraction of the early-activated wall in the first 70\% of the systolic ejection phase; (4) peak contraction of the late-activated wall after aortic valve closure. Each component scored 1 point, thus the maximum was 12 points. Results: Responders reached higher mean RSPI values than non-responders (5.86 {$\pm$} 2.9 vs. 4.08 {$\pm$} 2.4; p = 0.044). In logistic regression analysis value of RSPI {$\geq$} 7 points was a predictor of favorable CRT effect (OR: 12; 95\% CI = 1.33\textendash 108.17; p = 0.004). Conclusions: RSPI could be a valuable predictor of positive outcome in HF patients treated with CRT.},

  abstract = {Background: We planned this study to evaluate the effects of left bundle branch block (LBBB) on systolic and diastolic functions of left ventricle (LV) that have not previously been investigated in detail. Material and Methods: Forty-five cases diagnosed as isolated LBBB according to the standard electrocardiographic criteria (group 1, mean age: 60 {$\pm$} 12 years) were taken as the case group and 65 cases with normal conduction system (group II, mean age 58 {$\pm$} 14 years) were taken as the control group. Echocardiography was performed to all patients and coronary angiography was performed to 21 patients in group I and 35 patients in group H. In addition to standard systolic and diastolic function parameters, isovolumetric relaxation time (IRT), isovolumetric contraction time (ICT), and ejection time (ET) were measured by echocardiography, and the myocardial performance index (MPI) [(IRT+ICT)/ ET] was calculated. LV end-diastolic pressure was calculated for the patients undergoing coronary angiography. Results: In group I, LV end-systolic diameter was greater (3.1 0.4 cm vs 2.8 0.4 cm, P {$<$} .001) and ejection fraction was lower (64\% {$\pm$} 6\% vs 68\% 6\%, P {$<$} .001) than those of group II. Rapid filling deceleration time and rate was markedly different in group I (respectively, 133 {$\pm$} 50 ms vs 166 {$\pm$} 24 ms, P {$<$} .001; 608 {$\pm$} 291 cm/s2 vs 383 {$\pm$} 116 cm/s2, P {$<$} .001). In addition, it was found that LBBB caused shortening of LV diastolic period and ET markedly (respectively, 347 {$\pm$} 116 ms vs 394 {$\pm$} 106 m P = .03; 255 {$\pm$} 40 ms vs 294 {$\pm$} 21 ms, P {$<$} .001) and prolongation of IRT and ICT (respectively; 124 {$\pm$} 36 ms vs 91 {$\pm$} 16 ms, 96 {$\pm$} 35 ms vs 38 {$\pm$} 9 ms, P {$<$} .001). The MPI was predominantly higher in group I (0.89 {$\pm$} 0.29 vs 0.40 {$\pm$} 0.06, P {$<$} .001). Invasively determined LV end-diastolic pressure was found higher in group I (14 {$\pm$} 3 mm Hg vs 10 {$\pm$} 3 mm Hg, P {$<$} .001). Conclusion: A marked elevation of the LV MPI and end-diastolic pressure, parallel to changes of conventional echocardiography parameters, in patients with isolated LBBB points out that LBBB causes marked deterioration on LV systolic and diastolic functions.},

  abstract = {This study was designed to examine the effect of left bundle branch block (LBBB) on systolic and diastolic function of the left ventricle (LV) in patients with heart failure and in normal subjects. Thirty-six patients with heart failure and LBBB (group I), 36 patients with heart failure with normal conduction (group II), and 41 subjects with isolated LBBB (group III) were compared. Coronary angiography was performed and LV end diastolic pressure was calculated. Echocardiography was performed on all patients. LV ejection fraction and mean rate of circum ferential shortening were calculated. The following Doppler parameters were evaluated: peak rapid filling velocity (E wave), peak atrial filling velocity (A wave), E- and A-wave integrals, E- wave acceleration time and deceleration time (EDT) and rates (EAR and EDR), the E/A ratio and its integral, and diastolic flow time (DT). The ejection time, isovolumetric relaxation time (IRT), and preejection period were measured using the aortic and mitral flow. LV end diastolic pressure was calculated as 28 {$\pm$}4 mm Hg, 22 {$\pm$}5 mm Hg, and 15 {$\pm$}3 mm Hg in groups I, II, and III, respectively. Although the systolic function parameters in group III patients were different, the diastolic function parameters of group II were found to be quite similar to those of group III patients. Comparison of group I patients with group II patients showed that there was a similarity between LV systolic function parameters while the diastolic function parameters were different (E/A, p = 0.004; EAR, p{$<$}0.001; EDR, p{$<$}0.001; EDT, p{$<$}0.001; IRT, p = 0.024; DT, p=0.03). In conclusion, this study evaluating the effects of LBBB in normal subjects (isolated LBBB) and patients with heart failure showed that LBBB causes diastolic function impairment in normal subjects similar to those of patients with heart failure, and also increases impairment of diastolic function in patients with heart failure.},

Methods In a 16-year follow-up study using a statewide database, we studied the occurrence of mortal and morbid cardiovascular (CV) events among patients without apparent ischemic heart disease who had left anterior hemiblock (LAHB, n=4273, right bundle branch block (RBBB) with LAHB (BFBB, n=1857) and left bundle branch block (LBBB, n=9484 compared to isolated RBBB (n=25288). Results After adjustment for demographics, co-morbidities and insurance, LAHB was associated with a significant excess risk of all-cause death (HR 1.134, 95\% CI 1.061-1.213, p=0.0002) and CV death (HR 1.329, 95\% CI 1.174-1.501, p{$<$}0.0001). BFBB was associated with excess HF (HR 1.190, 95\% CI 1.048-1.351, p{$<$}0.0071), all-cause death (HR 1.440, 95\% CI 1.045-1.252, p=0.0036) and CV death (HR 1.210, 95\% CI 1.020-1.436, p{$<$}0.0001). LBBB was associated with an excess risk of MR (HR 1.307, 95\% CI 1.116-1.530, p{$<$}0.0009), HF 1.177, 95\% CI1.097-1.263, p{$<$}0.0001) and CV death (HR 1.220, 95\% CI 1.106-1.345, p{$<$}0.0001). Conclusions In patients without apparent ischemic heart disease, the presence of LAHB alone or in combination with RBBB imparts increased risk of CV and all-cause death compared to isolated RBBB. BFBB is also associated with an increased risk of HF.},

However, matching in a case-control study does not control for confounding by the matching factors; in fact it can introduce confounding by the matching factors even when it did not exist in the source population. Thus, a matched design may require controlling for the matching factors in the analysis. However, it is not the case that a matched design requires a matched analysis. Provided that there are no problems of sparse data, control for the matching factors can be obtained, with no loss of validity and a possible increase in precision, using a ``standard'' (unconditional) analysis, and a ``matched'' (conditional) analysis may not be required or appropriate.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

A wide range of CMR sequences have been developed to assess various aspects of cardiac structure and function, and significant advances have also been made in terms of imaging quality and acquisition times. A lot of research has been dedicated to the development of global and regional quantitative CMR indices that help the distinction between health and pathology. The goal of this review paper is to discuss the structural and functional CMR indices that have been proposed thus far for clinical assessment of the cardiac chambers. We include indices definitions, the requirements for the calculations, exemplar applications in cardiovascular diseases, and the corresponding normal ranges. Furthermore, we review the most recent state-of-the art techniques for the automatic segmentation of the cardiac boundaries, which are necessary for the calculation of the CMR indices. Finally, we provide a detailed discussion of the existing literature and of the future challenges that need to be addressed to enable a more robust and comprehensive assessment of the cardiac chambers in clinical practice.},

This paper puts forth an interpretation for each point on the ROC curve as being a conditional probability of a test result from a random diseased subject exceeding that from a random non diseased subject. This interpretation gives rise to new methods for making inference about ROC curves. It is shown that inference can be achieved with binary regression techniques applied to indicator variables constructed from pairs of test results, one component of the pair being from a diseased subject and the other from a non diseased subject. Within the generalized linear model (GLM) binary regression framework, ROC curves can be estimated, and we highlight a new semiparametric estimator. Covariate effects can also be evaluated with the GLM models. The methodology is applied to a pancreatic cancer dataset where we use the regression framework to compare two different serum biomarkers. Asymptotic distribution theory is developed to facilitate inference and to provide insight into factors influencing variability of estimated model parameters.},

Underlying molecular, cellular, and interstitial changes manifest clinically as changes in size, mass, geometry, and function of the heart. Cardiac remodeling is associated with progressive ventricular dysfunction, arrhythmias, and impaired prognosis. Clinical and diagnostic notions about LBBB have evolved from a simple electrocardiographic alteration to a critically important finding affecting diagnostic and clinical management of many patients. Advances in cardiac magnetic resonance imaging have significantly improved the assessment of patients with LBBB and provided additional insights into pathophysiological mechanisms of left ventricular remodeling.

  abstract = {Handling dependence or not in feature selection is still an open question in supervised classification issues where the number of covariates exceeds the number of observations. Some recent papers surprisingly show the superiority of naive Bayes approaches based on an obviously erroneous assumption of independence, whereas others recommend to infer on the dependence structure in order to decorrelate the selection statistics. In the classical linear discriminant analysis (LDA) framework, the present paper first highlights the impact of dependence in terms of instability of feature selection. A second objective is to revisit the above issue using a flexible factor modeling for the covariance. This framework introduces latent components of dependence, conditionally on which a new Bayes consistency is defined. A procedure is then proposed for the joint estimation of the expectation and variance parameters of the model. The present method is compared to recent regularized diagonal discriminant analysis approaches, assuming independence among features, and regularized LDA procedures, both in terms of classification performance and stability of feature selection. The proposed method is implemented in the R package FADA, freely available from the R repository CRAN.},

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the interplay between the prediction of the response to CRT and the definition of a favorable outcome. Methods Seventy patients who received CRT were included. All patients met current guideline criteria for CRT. Forty-three echocardiographic parameters were evaluated before CRT and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. M-mode, 2D echocardiography, and Doppler imaging were used to quantify left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic function, mitral regurgitation, right ventricular systolic function, pulmonary artery pressure, and myocardial mechanical dyssynchrony. The following definitions of a favorable CRT response were used: left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) improvement more {$>$}5\% acutely following CRT, LVEF improvement {$>$}20\% at 12-month follow-up, and a LV end-systolic volume (LVESV) decrease {$>$}15\% at 12-month follow-up. Results For the LVEF improvement {$>$}5\%, the best predictor was isovolumetric relaxation time (IVRT; P=.035). For improvement of LVEF {$>$}20\%, the best predictors were left ventricular stroke index (LVSI; P=.044) and left ventricular fractional shortening (LVFS; P=.031). For the drop in left ventricular systolic volume (LVESV {$>$}15\%), the best predictor was septal-to-lateral wall delay ({$\Delta$}T) (P=.043, RR=1.023, 95\% CI for RR=1.001-1.045). Conclusion The definition of a favorable CRT response influenced the optimal predictor variable(s). Standardization of defining a favorable response to CRT is needed to guide clinical decision making processes.},

Tagged cine and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) images were performed. Dyssynchrony was assessed with inTag toolbox and LGE was quantified using cutoff value at half of maximal signal in the scar. Cardiopulmonary exercise test, echocardiography and blood testing for NT-proBNP levels were done at baseline and 6 months after CRT.; Results: 52 patients (age 60.3 {$\pm$} 13 years) were included. 26 patients (50\%) met response criteria. The ischaemic etiology of HF was more frequent (69\% vs. 31\%, p=0.002), the percent of LGE was higher (7.7\% [0-13.5\%] vs. 19.0\% (0-31.9\%], p=0.013), regional vector of circumferential strain variance (RVV) was lower (0.27 {$\pm$} 0.08 vs. 0.34 {$\pm$} 0.09, p=0.009) and uniformity of radial strain was higher (0.72 {$\pm$} 0.25 vs. 0.56 {$\pm$} 0.29, p=0.046) in non-responders vs. responders. Multivariate logistic regression showed that RVV predicted response to CRT (HR 2.3, 95\% CI 1.02-5.02, p=0.0430) independently of LGE and the etiology of heart failure. In the subgroup of patients with ischaemic HF the extend of transmural scar within myocardium was higher in non-responders vs. responders (26.3\% vs. 15.0\% respectively, p=0.01) and was a predictor of response to CRT in univariable analysis (HR 0.87, 95\% CI 0.77-0.98, p=0.025) providing the sensitivity of 76\% and specificity of 75\% at the cutoff point of 18\% in the prediction of poor response to CRT. In patients with non-ischaemic HF QRS was wider (162 ms vs. 140 ms, p=0.04), regional vector of strain variance (RVV) was higher (0.39 vs. 0.25, p=0.002) and uniformity of radial strain was lower (0.52 vs. 0.80, p=0.049) in non-responders vs. responders. Univariable logistic regression showed that RVV was a predictor of response to CRT (HR 1.50, 95\% CI 1.06-2.13, p=0.022), providing the sensitivity of 94\% and specificity of 85\% at the cutoff point of 0.31.; Conclusions: CMR derived parameters of dyssynchrony such as RVV may provide an additive value in prediction of response to CRT, especially in patients with non-ischaemic etiology of heart failure. In patients with ischaemic HF the transmurality of LGE is an important predictor of lack of response to CRT.; Copyright \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Since it was commonly misdiagnosed as a thrombus, the ridge is also known as the 'coumadin' or 'warfarin' ridge. The left atrial ridge is a potential source of arrhythmias and can be an obstacle in ablation procedures. This study aimed to provide information about the occurrence and spatial morphometric characteristics of the left atrial ridge. Methods and Results The macroscopic morphology of the left atrial ridge was assessed in 200 autopsied human hearts. The ridge was observed in 59.5\% of specimens and was absent in the remaining 40.5\% of cases. The mean length of the ridge was 22.4?{$\pm$}?5.1?mm. It was wider at its inferior sector when compared to its superior sector (9.1?{$\pm$}?5.0 vs 7.9?{$\pm$}?3.2?mm; P?=?.028). The total wall thickness measured at the cross section of the ridge was significantly larger in the inferior than in superior sector (6.2?{$\pm$}?3.5 vs 4.3?{$\pm$}?1.8?mm; P?},

When those steps have been described in sufficient detail that others can retrace the steps and obtain similar results, the research is said to be reproducible. Computers play a vital role in many research disciplines and present both opportunities and challenges for reproducibility. Computers can be programmed to execute analysis tasks, and those programs can be repeated and shared with others. The deterministic nature of most computer programs means that the same analysis tasks, applied to the same data, will often produce the same outputs. However, in practice, computational findings often cannot be reproduced because of complexities in how software is packaged, installed, and executed\textemdash and because of limitations associated with how scientists document analysis steps. Many tools and techniques are available to help overcome these challenges; here we describe seven such strategies. With a broad scientific audience in mind, we describe the strengths and limitations of each approach, as well as the circumstances under which each might be applied. No single strategy is sufficient for every scenario; thus we emphasize that it is often useful to combine approaches.},

  abstract = {PurposeCardiac disease frequently has a degenerative effect on cardiac pump function and regional myocardial contraction. Therefore, an accurate assessment of regional wall motion is a measure of the extent and severity of the disease. We sought to further validate an intra-operative, sensor-based technology for measuring wall motion and strain by characterizing left ventricular (LV) mechanical and electrical activation patterns in patients with normal (NSF) and impaired systolic function (ISF).MethodsNSF (n = 10; ejection fraction = 62.9 {$\pm$} 6.1\%) and ISF (n = 18; ejection fraction = 35.1 {$\pm$} 13.6\%) patients underwent simultaneous electrical and motion mapping of the LV endocardium using electroanatomical mapping and navigational systems (EnSite\texttrademark{} NavX\texttrademark{} and MediGuide\texttrademark, Abbott). Motion trajectories, strain profiles, and activation times were calculated over the six standard LV walls.ResultsNSF patients had significantly greater motion and systolic strains across all LV walls than ISF patients. LV walls with low-voltage areas showed less motion and systolic strain than walls with normal voltage. LV electrical dyssynchrony was significantly smaller in NSF and ISF patients with narrow-QRS complexes than ISF patients with wide-QRS complexes, but mechanical dyssynchrony was larger in all ISF patients than NSF patients. The latest mechanical activation was most often the lateral/posterior walls in NSF and wide-QRS ISF patients but varied in narrow-QRS ISF patients.ConclusionsThis intra-operative technique can be used to characterize LV wall motion and strain in patients with impaired systolic function. This technique may be utilized clinically to provide individually tailored LV lead positioning at the region of latest mechanical activation for patients undergoing cardiac resynchronization therapy.Clinical trial registrationURL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

Objective To assess the hypothesis that electrical dyssynchrony is required to obtain hemodynamic benefit from BiV pacing by investigating the relationship between intrinsic QRS duration and hemodynamic response to BiV pacing in a patient population covering a broad spectrum of QRS duration. Methods Eighty-two consecutive heart failure patients underwent cardiac resynchronization therapy implantation irrespective of their QRS duration. Thirty-four patients had a narrow QRS duration ({$<$}120 ms), whereas 11 patients had a moderately prolonged QRS duration ({$\geq$}120 to {$<$}150 ms) and 37 patients had a severely prolonged QRS duration ({$\geq$}150 ms). After implantation, invasive left ventricular (LV) dP/dt measurements were compared between intrinsic rhythm and simultaneous BiV pacing with an optimized atrioventricular delay. Results A high correlation (r = .65; P {$<$} .001) was observed between baseline QRS duration and changes in LV dP/dtmax induced by BiV pacing. BiV pacing was ineffective in patients with a narrow QRS duration (+0.4\% {$\pm$} 6.1\%; P = ns). No significant increase in LV dP/dtmax was observed in patients with a QRS duration of {$\geq$}120 to {$<$}150 ms (+4.4\% {$\pm$} 6.9\%; P = .06), whereas patients with a QRS duration of {$\geq$}150 ms exhibited a significant increase in LV dP/dtmax (+17.1\% {$\pm$} 13.4\%; P {$<$}.001). Only 9\% of the patients with a narrow QRS duration exhibited a {$\geq$}10\% increase in LV dP/dtmax. Conclusions Baseline QRS duration is linearly related to acute hemodynamic response to BiV pacing. Patients with a narrow QRS duration do not derive hemodynamic improvement. This improvement is also limited in patients with a moderately prolonged QRS duration, raising questions about the potential clinical benefit of this therapy in these patients.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES This study is to establish the association of left atrial reservoir strain (LARS) with incident heart failure (HF), and the impact of substituting LARS for left atrial (LA) volume index (LAVI) in diastolic assessment. BACKGROUND LARS measures passive LA stretch and is a sensitive marker of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (DD). The potential contribution of LARS to diastolic assessment is unclear. METHODS Baseline clinical and echocardiographic assessments were obtained in 758 asymptomatic, communitydwelling elderly subjects (age 70 [interquartile range: 67 to 74] years, 53\% women) with nonischemic HF risk factors. LARS-defined DD (LARS-DD) was assessed by speckle-tracking echocardiography, and grades were assigned as normal ({$>$}35\%), grade 1 (25\% to 35\%) and grade 2 (\#24\%). DD grade using current recommendations was compared with grading using LARS {$<$}24\% in place of LAVI {$>$}34 ml/m2. Patients were followed for up to 2 years for incident HF. RESULTS LA strain analysis was feasible in 738 (97\%) patients; average LARS was 39\% (range 34\% to 43\%). Incident HF was associated with LARS-DD grade; 8 (36\%) of those had grade 2\th, 14 (10\%) had grade 1, and 39 (9\%) had normal function (p {$<$} 0.001). LARS-DD grade 2\th{} predicted incident HF after adjustment for clinical and echocardiographic markers (adjusted hazard ratio: 2.5; 95\% confidence interval: 1.02 to 6.3; p {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.049); there was no significant HF risk associated with LARS-DD grade 1. Dichotomized abnormal LARS {$<$}24\% had an adjusted hazard ratio of 2.9 (95\% confidence interval: 1.25 to 6.79; p {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.013). Substituting LARS for LAVI provided a 75\% reduction in indeterminate diastolic function; all were recategorized as normal. There was no increased risk associated normal diastolic function by this grading compared to conventional grading (C-statistic {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.76 for both models). CONCLUSIONS LARS-DD grade 2\th{} is associated with incident HF in the elderly, independent of LAVI. The substitution of LARS for LAVI reduces the number of indeterminate cases without impacting prognosis in normal diastolic function and grade 1 DD.

Dyssynchrony was determined as the standard deviation of time to peak transverse strain between 12 segments of apical four- and two-chamber views, and contractile function as global longitudinal strain (GLS) by averaging longitudinal strain over these 12 segments. We compared changes in LV dyssynchrony and contractile function between treatment groups and assessed relationships between these changes over the first year and subsequent outcomes (median post 1-year follow-up = 14.9 months). Mean changes in LV dyssynchrony and contractile function measured by GLS in the overall population were, respectively, -29 {$\pm$} 83 ms and -1 {$\pm$} 2.9\%. However, both LV dyssynchrony (CRT-D: -47 {$\pm$} 83 ms vs. ICD: -6 {$\pm$} 76 ms, P \&lt; 0.001) and contractile function (CRT-D: -1.4 {$\pm$} 3.1\% vs. ICD: -0.4 {$\pm$} 2.5\%, P \&lt; 0.001) improved to a greater extent in the CRT-D group compared with the ICD-only group. A greater improvement in dyssynchrony and contractile function at 1 year was associated with lower rates of the subsequent primary outcome of death or heart failure, adjusting for baseline dyssynchrony and contractile function, treatment arm, ischaemic status, and change in LV end-systolic volume. Each 20 ms decrease in LV dyssynchrony was associated with a 7\% reduction in the primary outcome (P = 0.047); each 1\% improvement in GLS over the 12-month period was associated with a 24\% reduction in the primary outcome (P \&lt; 0.001).Cardiac resynchronization therapy resulted in a significant improvement in both LV dyssynchrony and contractile function measured by GLS compared with ICD only and these improvements were associated with better subsequent outcomes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Among patients with angina and nonobstructive coronary artery disease, those with coronary microvascular dysfunction have a poor outcome. Coronary microvascular dysfunction is usually diagnosed by assessing flow reserve with an endothelium-independent vasodilator like adenosine, but the optimal diagnostic threshold is unclear. Furthermore, the incremental value of testing endothelial function has never been assessed before. We sought to determine what pharmacological thresholds correspond to exercise pathophysiology and myocardial ischemia in patients with coronary microvascular dysfunction. METHODS: Patients with angina and nonobstructive coronary artery disease underwent simultaneous acquisition of coronary pressure and flow during rest, supine bicycle exercise, and pharmacological vasodilatation with adenosine and acetylcholine. Adenosine and acetylcholine coronary flow reserve were calculated as vasodilator/resting coronary blood flow (CFR and AchFR, respectively). Coronary wave intensity analysis was used to quantify the proportion of accelerating wave energy; a normal exercise response was defined as an increase in accelerating wave energy from rest to peak exercise. Ischemia was assessed by quantitative 3-Tesla stress perfusion cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and dichotomously defined by a hyperemic endo-epicardial gradient {$<$}1.0. RESULTS: Ninety patients were enrolled (58{$\pm$}10 years, 77\% female). Area under the curve using receiver-operating characteristic analysis demonstrated optimal CFR and AchFR thresholds for identifying exercise pathophysiology and ischemia as 2.6 and 1.5, with positive and negative predictive values of 91\% and 86\%, respectively. Fifty-eight percent had an abnormal CFR (of which 96\% also had an abnormal AchFR). Of those with a normal CFR, 53\% had an abnormal AchFR, and 47\% had a normal AchFR; ischemia rates were 83\%, 63\%, and 14\%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The optimal CFR and AchFR diagnostic thresholds are 2.6 and 1.5, with high-positive and negative predictive values, respectively. A normal CFR value should prompt the measurement of AchFR. A stepwise algorithm incorporating both vasodilators can accurately identify an ischemic cause in patients with nonobstructive coronary artery disease.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To use singular value decomposition (SVD) in heart failure (HF) to reveal primary spatiotemporal strain patterns in the left ventricle (LV), then develop and test a time-independent metric of cardiac dyssynchrony on the basis of the circumferential uniformity ratio estimate (CURE) computed with SVD (CURE-SVD) in both a canine model of HF with or without left bundle branch block (LBBB) and a clinical cohort referred for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The research was approved by the institutional review board and conformed with HIPAA requirements. All subjects provided informed consent. In both the canine model (n = 13) and the clinical cohort (80 CRT candidates; mean age, 65.2 years; range, 18.5-86.9 years), regional strains were derived by using cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) displacement encoding with stimulated echoes. CURE-SVD was compared with the standard CURE (averaged over systolic phases). Statistical methods included the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, Hodges-Lehmann estimator, Bland-Altman test, multivariable logistic regression, and receiver operating characteristic analysis. RESULTS: In the canine model, the median difference in CURE-SVD (range, 0-1) for LBBB-HF group versus narrow-QRS-HF group (-0.40; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: -0.79, -0.31) was similar to that for CURE (-0.43; 95\% CI: -0.72, -0.34]). In 80 CRT candidates, CURE-SVD and CURE were highly correlated (r = 0.90; P {$<$} .0001). The multivariable model for CRT response with CURE-SVD demonstrated excellent performance without the need for time averaging over cardiac phases (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.96, P {$<$} .0001). CONCLUSION: SVD of circumferential strain in HF identifies primary LV spatiotemporal contraction patterns with minimal user input, while the time-independent CURE-SVD parameter has excellent performance in a canine model of dyssynchrony and is strongly associated with CRT response in patients with HF.},

This article reviews different techniques that can be used for each of these three subtasks and discusses the main advantages and disadvantages of each technique with references to theoretical and empirical studies. Further, recommendations are given to encourage best practices in research and applications of machine learning. Common methods such as the holdout method for model evaluation and selection are covered, which are not recommended when working with small datasets. Different flavors of the bootstrap technique are introduced for estimating the uncertainty of performance estimates, as an alternative to confidence intervals via normal approximation if bootstrapping is computationally feasible. In the context of discussing the bias-variance trade-off, leave-one-out cross-validation is compared to k-fold cross-validation, and practical tips for the optimal choice of k are given based on empirical evidence. Different statistical tests for algorithm comparisons are presented, and strategies for dealing with multiple comparisons such as omnibus tests and multiple-comparison corrections are discussed. Finally, alternative methods for algorithm selection, such as 5\texttimes 2cv cross-validation and nested cross-validation, are recommended for comparing machine learning algorithms when datasets are small.},

Velocity fields were viewed with dedicated software and evaluated for the duration of vortical blood flow in the main pulmonary artery (tvortex, the percentage of cardiac phases with vortex present). The relationship between mPAP at RHC and tvortex was assessed by means of a segmented linear regression model, and by Bland-Altman and receiver operating characteristic curve analyses.ResultsThe relationship between mPAP and tvortex was described adequately (R2 = 0.95) as linearly increasing, from tvortex of 0\% (mPAP {$\leq$} 16.0 mm Hg) with a slope of 1.59\% per millimeter of mercury. The standard deviation between mPAP values derived from RHC and those estimated by using tvortex was 3.9 mm Hg. The area under the curve for tvortex-based diagnosis of PH was 0.994 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.982, 0.998), and the calculated PH cut-off value (tvortex {$\geq$} 14.3\%) resulted in sensitivity of 0.97 (95\% CI: 0.90, 0.99) and specificity of 0.96 (95\% CI: 0.89, 0.99).

While cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) has become a common part of heart failure work-up, CMR features of mechanical dyssynchrony in patients with LBBB have not been well characterized. This study aims to investigate the potential of CMR to characterize mechanical features of LBBB. CMR examinations from 43 patients with LBBB on their electrocardiogram, but without significant focal structural abnormalities, and from 43 age- and gender-matched normal controls were retrospectively reviewed. The following mechanical features of LBBB were evaluated: septal flash (SF), apical rocking (AR), delayed aortic valve opening measured relative to both end-diastole (AVOED) and pulmonic valve opening (AVOPVO), delayed left-ventricular (LV) free-wall contraction, and curvatures of the septum and LV free-wall. Septal displacement curves were also generated, using feature-tracking techniques. The echocardiographic findings of LBBB were also reviewed in those subjects for whom they were available. LBBB was significantly associated with the presence of SF and AR; within the LBBB group, 79 \% had SF and 65 \% had AR. Delayed AVOED, AVOPVO, and delayed LV free-wall contraction were significantly associated with LBBB. AVOED and AVOPVO positively correlated with QRS duration and negatively correlated with ejection fraction. Hearts with electrocardiographic evidence of LBBB showed lower septal-to-LV free-wall curvature ratios at end-diastole compared to normal controls. CMR can be used to identify and evaluate mechanical dyssynchrony in patients with LBBB. None of the normal controls showed the mechanical features associated with LBBB. Moreover, not all patients with LBBB showed the same degree of mechanical dyssynchrony, which could have implications for CRT.},

  abstract = {In prediction model research, external validation is needed to examine an existing model's performance using data independent to that for model development. Current external validation studies often suffer from small sample sizes and consequently imprecise predictive performance estimates. To address this, we propose how to determine the minimum sample size needed for a new external validation study of a prediction model for a binary outcome. Our calculations aim to precisely estimate calibration (Observed/Expected and calibration slope), discrimination (C-statistic), and clinical utility (net benefit). For each measure, we propose closed-form and iterative solutions for calculating the minimum sample size required. These require specifying: (i) target SEs (confidence interval widths) for each estimate of interest, (ii) the anticipated outcome event proportion in the validation population, (iii) the prediction model's anticipated (mis)calibration and variance of linear predictor values in the validation population, and (iv) potential risk thresholds for clinical decision-making. The calculations can also be used to inform whether the sample size of an existing (already collected) dataset is adequate for external validation. We illustrate our proposal for external validation of a prediction model for mechanical heart valve failure with an expected outcome event proportion of 0.018. Calculations suggest at least 9835 participants (177 events) are required to precisely estimate the calibration and discrimination measures, with this number driven by the calibration slope criterion, which we anticipate will often be the case. Also, 6443 participants (116 events) are required to precisely estimate net benefit at a risk threshold of 8\%. Software code is provided.},

  abstract = {The relationship between myocardial electrical activation by electrocardiogram (ECG) and mechanical contraction by echocardiography in left bundle-branch block (LBBB) has never been clearly demonstrated. New strict criteria for LBBB based on a fundamental understanding of physiology have recently been independently published for both ECG and echocardiography. The relationship between the 2 modalities and the relation to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) response was investigated. Sixty-six patients with LBBB by conventional criteria had a standard 12-lead ECG and 2-dimensional strain echocardiography performed before CRT implantation. Criteria for LBBB by echocardiography included early termination of contraction in one wall and prestretch and late contraction in opposing wall(s). New strict criteria by ECG included QRS duration {$\geq$}140 ms (men) or 130 ms (women), QS or rS in leads V1 and V2, and mid-QRS notching or slurring in {$\geq$}2 of leads V1, V2, V5, V6, I, and aVL. Response was defined as {$>$}15\% decrease in left ventricular end-systolic volume after 6 months. In 64 of 66 patients, ECG analysis was possible. Echo and ECG readings for LBBB presence were concordant in 54 (84\%) of 64. Thirty-seven (82\%) of 45 patients with LBBB by strict ECG criteria responded to CRT, whereas only 4 (21\%) of the 19 patients without LBBB responded (sensitivity 90\% and specificity 65\%). Thirty-six (95\%) of 38 patients with concordance for the presence of LBBB responded to CRT. In patients with concordance for the absence of LBBB, 15 (94\%) of 16 did not respond. For the first time, a close relation has been demonstrated between electrical activation by ECG and mechanical contraction by echocardiography. These findings may help identify CRT candidates.},

  abstract = {Objectives The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) feature-tracking\textendash derived global longitudinal strain (GLS) in a large multicenter population of patients with ischemic and nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. Background Direct assessment of myocardial fiber deformation with GLS using echocardiography or CMR feature tracking has shown promise in providing prognostic information incremental to ejection fraction (EF) in single-center studies. Given the growing use of CMR for assessing persons with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, we hypothesized that feature-tracking\textendash derived GLS may provide independent prognostic information in a multicenter population of patients with ischemic and nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. Methods Consecutive patients at 4 U.S. medical centers undergoing CMR with EF~\&lt;50\% and ischemic or nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy were included in this study. Feature-tracking GLS was calculated from 3 long-axis cine-views. The primary endpoint was all-cause death. Cox proportional hazards regression modeling was used to examine the association between GLS and death. Incremental prognostic value of GLS was assessed in nested models. Results Of the 1,012 patients in this study, 133 died during median follow-up of 4.4 years. By Kaplan-Meier analysis, the risk of death increased significantly with worsening GLS tertiles (log-rank p~\&lt; 0.0001). Each 1\% worsening in GLS was associated with an 89.1\% increased risk of death after adjustment for clinical and imaging risk factors including EF and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) (hazard ratio [HR]:1.891 per \%; p~\&lt; 0.001). Addition of GLS in this model resulted in significant improvement in the C-statistic (0.628 to 0.867; p~\&lt; 0.0001). Continuous net reclassification improvement (NRI) was 1.148 (95\% confidence interval: 0.996 to 1.318). GLS was independently associated with death after adjustment for clinical and imaging risk factors (including EF and late gadolinium enhancement) in both ischemic (HR: 1.942 per \%; p~\&lt; 0.001) and nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy subgroups (HR: 2.101 per \%; p~\&lt; 0.001). Conclusions CMR feature-tracking\textendash derived GLS is a powerful independent predictor of mortality in a multicenter population of patients with ischemic or nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, incremental to common clinical and CMR risk factors including EF and LGE.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Cardiac-resynchronization therapy (CRT) reduces morbidity and mortality in chronic systolic heart failure with a wide QRS complex. Mechanical dyssynchrony also occurs in patients with a narrow QRS complex, which suggests the potential usefulness of CRT in such patients. METHODS We conducted a randomized trial involving 115 centers to evaluate the effect of CRT in patients with New York Heart Association class III or IV heart failure, a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35\% or less, a QRS duration of less than 130 msec, and echocardiographic evidence of left ventricular dyssynchrony. All patients underwent device implantation and were randomly assigned to have CRT capability turned on or off. The primary efficacy outcome was the composite of death from any cause or first hospitalization for worsening heart failure. RESULTS On March 13, 2013, the study was stopped for futility on the recommendation of the data and safety monitoring board. At study closure, the 809 patients who had undergone randomization had been followed for a mean of 19.4 months. The primary outcome occurred in 116 of 404 patients in the CRT group, as compared with 102 of 405 in the control group (28.7\% vs. 25.2\%; hazard ratio, 1.20; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.92 to 1.57; P\,=\,0.15). There were 45 deaths in the CRT group and 26 in the control group (11.1\% vs. 6.4\%; hazard ratio, 1.81; 95\% CI, 1.11 to 2.93; P\,=\,0.02). CONCLUSIONS In patients with systolic heart failure and a QRS duration of less than 130 msec, CRT does not reduce the rate of death or hospitalization for heart failure and may increase mortality.

  abstract = {During left bundle branch block (LBBB), electromechanical delay (EMD), defined as time from regional electrical activation (REA) to onset shortening, is prolonged in the late-activated left ventricular lateral wall compared with the septum. This leads to greater mechanical relative to electrical dyssynchrony. The aim of this study was to determine the mechanism of the prolonged EMD. We investigated this phenomenon in an experimental LBBB dog model (n = 7), in patients (n = 9) with biventricular pacing devices, in an in vitro papillary muscle study (n = 6), and a mathematical simulation model. Pressures, myocardial deformation, and REA were assessed. In the dogs, there was a greater mechanical than electrical delay (82 {$\pm$} 12 vs. 54 {$\pm$} 8 ms, P = 0.002) due to prolonged EMD in the lateral wall vs. septum (39 {$\pm$} 8 vs.11 {$\pm$} 9 ms, P = 0.002). The prolonged EMD in later activated myocardium could not be explained by increased excitation-contraction coupling time or increased pressure at the time of REA but was strongly related to dP/dt at the time of REA (r = 0.88). Results in humans were consistent with experimental findings. The papillary muscle study and mathematical model showed that EMD was prolonged at higher dP/dt because it took longer for the segment to generate active force at a rate superior to the load rise, which is a requirement for shortening. We conclude that, during LBBB, prolonged EMD in late-activated myocardium is caused by a higher dP/dt at the time of activation, resulting in aggravated mechanical relative to electrical dyssynchrony. These findings suggest that LV contractility may modify mechanical dyssynchrony.},

  abstract = {Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is becoming increasingly controversial in patients without typical left bundle branch block (LBBB). Yet, several recent studies displayed that a distinct subpopulation of patients with non-LBBB does benefit from CRT. Patients with non-LBBB should, therefore, not as a group be withheld from a potentially very beneficial therapy. Unfortunately, current clinical practice lacks validated selection criteria that may identify possible CRT responders in the non-LBBB subgroup. Consequently, clinical decision making in these patients is often challenging. A few studies, strongly differing in design, have proposed additive selection criteria for improved response prediction in patients with non-LBBB. There is accumulating evidence that more sophisticated echocardiographic dyssynchrony markers, taking into account the underlying electrical substrate responsive to CRT, can aid in the selection of patients with a non-LBBB who may benefit more favorably from CRT. Furthermore, it is important that cardiologists are aware of the shortcomings of current electrocardiographic selection criteria for CRT. Whereas these criteria provide an evidence-based approach for selecting patients for CRT, they do not necessarily guarantee the most optimal strategy for patient selection. Parameters obtained with vectorcardiography, such as QRS area, show potential to overcome the shortcomings of conventional electrocardiographic selection criteria and may improve response prediction regardless of QRS morphology.},

Currently, a post-hoc diagnosis of LBBB-induced cardiomyopathy is possible when evaluating patients' response to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). However, an early detection of a LBBB-induced cardiomyopathy could have significant clinical and therapeutic implications. Patients with the aforementioned form of dyssynchronopathy may benefit from early CRT and overall prognosis might be better as compared to patients with a primary muscle cell disorder (i.e. ``true'' DCM). The real underlying mechanisms, the possible genetic background as well as the early identification of this specific form of DCM remain largely unknown. In this review the complex relationship between LBBB and left ventricular non-ischaemic dysfunction is described. Furthermore, a multiparametric approach based on clinical, electrocardiographic and imaging red flags, is provided in order to allow an early detection of the LBBB-induced cardiomyopathy.},

In particular, whether LV mechanics assessed by FT-SSFP predicts outcomes in subjects with heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), or without HF is unknown. We aimed to assess whether LV mechanics measured with FT-SSFP cine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) predicts adverse outcomes. We prospectively enrolled 612 adults without HF (n\,=\,402), with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF; n\,=\,113), or HFpEF (n\,=\,97) and assessed LV strain using FT-SSFP cine MRI. Over a median follow-up of 39.5 months, 75 participants had an HF admission, and 85 died. In Cox proportional hazards models, lower global longitudinal (Standardized hazard ratio 1.56, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.22 to 2.00, p\,=\,0.0004), circumferential (Standardized HR 1.46, 95\% CI 1.08 to 1.95, p\,=\,0.0123), and radial strain (Standardized HR 0.59, 95\% CI 0.43 to 0.83, p\,=\,0.0019) were independently associated with the composite endpoint, after adjustment for HF status, LV ejection fraction (LVEF), age, sex, ethnicity, body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, and glomerular filtration rate. Furthermore, global longitudinal strain stratified the risk of adverse outcomes across tertiles better than LVEF. In analyses that included only participants with a preserved LVEF, systolic radial, circumferential and longitudinal strain were independently predictive of adverse outcomes. We conclude that LV longitudinal, circumferential and radial strain measured using FT-SSFP cine MRI (a readily implementable technique in clinical practice) predict the risk of adverse events, independently of LVEF.},

Invasive flow investigations have suggested that up to two-thirds of patients with nonobstructive coronary atherosclerosis may have microvascular dysfunction (MVD). Positron emission tomography myocardial perfusion imaging in conjunction with tracer-kinetic modeling enables the concurrent quantification of myocardial blood flow (MBF) in milliliters per minute per gram of tissue. This allows the assessment of hyperemic MBFs and myocardial flow reserve for the noninvasive identification and characterization of MVD as an important functional substrate for angina symptoms amenable to intensified and individualized medical intervention with nitrates, calcium-channel blockers, statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and/or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers. Recent investigations suggest that cardiac magnetic resonance and computed tomography may also be suitable for the noninvasive detection of MVD. Whether intensified and individualized treatment related improvement or even normalization of hyperemic MBF and/or myocardial flow reserve may lead to a persistent reduction in angina symptoms and/or improved cardiovascular outcome as compared to standard care, deserves further testing in large-scale randomized clinical trials.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To investigate the reproducibility of regional and global strain and strain rate (SR) parameters of both ventricles and to determine sample sizes for all investigated strain and SR parameters in order to generate a practical reference for future studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study population consisted of 20 healthy individuals and 20 patients with acute myocarditis. Cine sequences in three horizontal long axis views and a stack of short axis views covering the entire left and right ventricle (LV, RV) were retrospectively analysed using a dedicated feature tracking (FT) software algorithm (TOMTEC). For intra-observer analysis, one observer analysed CMR images of all patients and volunteers twice. For inter-observer analysis, three additional blinded observers analysed the same datasets once. Intra- and inter-observer reproducibility were tested in all patients and controls using Bland-Altman analyses, intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) and coefficients of variation. RESULTS: Intra-observer reproducibility of global LV strain and SR parameters was excellent (range of ICCs: 0.81-1.00), the only exception being global radial SR with a poor reproducibility (ICC 0.23). On a regional level, basal and midventricular strain and SR parameters were more reproducible when compared to apical parameters. Inter-observer reproducibility of all LV parameters was slightly lower than intra-observer reproducibility, yet still good to excellent for all global and regional longitudinal and circumferential strain and SR parameters (range of ICCs: 0.66-0.93). Similar to the LV, all global RV longitudinal and circumferential strain and SR parameters showed an excellent reproducibility, (range of ICCs: 0.75-0.97). Radial strain and SR parameters were less reproducible in the LV as well as in the RV when compared to circumferential or longitudinal parameters. CONCLUSION: CMR FT using the TOMTEC algorithm is highly reproducible in health and disease in both, the LV and RV on a global and regional level. The only exceptions are radial strain and SR parameters, which should be used with caution within clinical studies. The sample sizes estimated on the basis of the present study might serve as a reference during the planning of future FT studies.},

However, based on ECG criteria, the discrimination between complete LBBB and nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay is challenging. We tested the hypothesis that discrimination can be performed using standard electrophysiological catheters and a simple stimulation protocol. METHODS: Fifty-nine patients were analyzed retrospectively. Patients were divided into groups of narrow QRS (n\,=\,20), wide QRS of right bundle branch block (RBBB) morphology (n\,=\,14), and wide QRS of LBBB morphology (n\,=\,25). Using a diagnostic catheter placed in the coronary sinus, left ventricular activation was assessed during intrinsic conduction as well as during right ventricular (RV) stimulation. RESULTS: In patients with narrow QRS and RBBB, the Q-LV/QRS ratio was 0.43\,{$\pm$}\,0.013 (n\,=\,20) and 0.41\,{$\pm$}\,0.026 (n\,=\,14), respectively. In patients with LBBB morphology, the Q-LV/QRS split up into a group of patients with normal (0.43\,{$\pm$}\,0.022, n\,=\,7) and a group with delayed left ventricular activation (0.75\,{$\pm$}\,0.016, n\,=\,18). By direct comparison of the Q-LV/QRS ratio during intrinsic conduction with the Q-LV/QRS ratio during RV pacing leading to a functional LBBB, a clear distinction between a group of "true LBBB" and another group of "apparent LBBB"/nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay (NICD) could be generated. CONCLUSIONS: We present a novel and practical method that might facilitate discrimination between patients with apparent LBBB and true LBBB by comparing Q-LV/QRS ratios during intrinsic activation and during RV stimulation. Although this method can already be directly applied, validation by 3D electrical mapping and prospective correlation to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) response will be required for further translation into clinical practice.},

Yet, control of false discoveries is challenging given the large number of genes versus the relatively small number of patients in a typical cancer study. To ensure that most of the discoveries are true, we employ a knockoff procedure to control false discoveries. Our method is general and flexible, accommodating arbitrary covariate distributions, linear and nonlinear associations, and survival models. In simulations, our method compares favorably to the alternatives; its utility of identifying important genes in real clinical applications is demonstrated by the identification of seven genes associated with Breslow thickness in skin cutaneous melanoma patients.},

We prospectively evaluated the clinical characteristics of patients according to these criteria and their prognosis. The primary endpoint was the composite of major cardiovascular events (MACE), verified by institutional investigators, which included cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and hospitalization due to heart failure or unstable angina. During the period from 1 July 2015 to 31 December 2018, 686 patients with MVA were registered from 14 institutes in 7 countries from 4 continents. Among them, 64\% were female and the main ethnic groups were Caucasians (61\%) and Asians (29\%). During follow-up of a median of 398 days (IQR 365\textendash 744), 78 MACE occurred (6.4\% in men vs. 8.6\% in women, P = 0.19). Multivariable Cox proportional hazard analysis disclosed that hypertension and previous history of coronary artery disease (CAD), including acute coronary syndrome and stable angina pectoris, were independent predictors of MACE. There was no sex or ethnic difference in prognosis, although women had lower Seattle Angina Questionnaire scores than men (P \&lt; 0.05).This first international study provides novel evidence that MVA is an important health problem regardless of sex or ethnicity that a diagnosis of MVA portends a substantial risk for MACE associated with hypertension and previous history of CAD, and that women have a lower quality of life than men despite the comparable prognosis.},

Each of these techniques was developed separately and has undergone significant change since its original implementation. As a result, in the current literature, the common features and the differences between the techniques and what they measure are often unclear and confusing. This review article delivers an extensively referenced introductory text which clarifies the current methodology from the starting point of the Bloch equations. By doing this in a consistent way for each method, the similarities and differences between them are highlighted. In addition, their capabilities and limitations are discussed, together with their relative advantages and disadvantages. While the focus is on sequence design and development, the principal parameters measured by each technique are also summarized, together with brief results, with the reader being directed to the extensive literature on data processing and clinical applications for more detail.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine the interstudy reproducibility of myocardial strain and peak early-diastolic strain rate (PEDSR) measurement on cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessed with feature tracking (FT) and tagging, in patients with aortic stenosis (AS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cardiac MRI was performed twice (1-14 days apart) in 18 patients (8 at 1.5 Tesla [T], 10 at 3T) with moderate-severe AS. Circumferential peak systolic strain (PSS) and PEDSR were measured in all patients. Longitudinal PSS and PEDSR were assessed using FT in all patients, and tagging in the 3T sub-group. RESULTS: PSS was higher with FT than tagging (21.0 +/- 1.9\% versus 17.0 +/- 3.4\% at 1.5T, 21.4 +/- 4.0\% versus 17.7 +/- 3.0\% at 3T, P {$<$} 0.05), as was PEDSR (1.3 +/- 0.3 s(-1) versus 1.0 +/- 0.3 s(-1) , P = 0.10 at 1.5T and 1.3 +/- 0.4 s(-1) versus 0.8 +/- 0.3 s(-1) , P {$<$} 0.05 at 3T). The reproducibility of PSS was excellent with FT (coefficient of variation [CoV] 9-10\%) and good with tagging at 1.5T (13-19\%). Reproducibility of circumferential PEDSR was best at 1.5T when only basal/mid slices were included (CoV 12\%), but moderate to poor at 3T (29-35\%). Reproducibility of longitudinal strain was good with FT (10-16\%) but moderate for PEDSR ( approximately 30\%). CONCLUSION: In patients with AS, FT consistently produces higher values compared with tagging. The interstudy reproducibility of PSS is excellent with FT and good with tagging. The reproducibility of circumferential PEDSR at 1.5T is good when only basal and mid slices are used.},

  abstract = {Background Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is effective in reducing clinical events in systolic heart failure patients with a wide QRS. Previous retrospective studies suggest only patients with QRS prolongation due to a left bundle-branch block (LBBB) benefit from CRT. Our objective was to examine this by performing a meta-analysis of all randomized controlled trials of CRT. Methods Systematic searches of MEDLINE and the Food and Drug Administration official website were conducted for randomized controlled CRT trials. Trials reporting adverse clinical events (eg, all-cause mortality, heart failure hospitalizations) according to QRS morphology were included in the meta-analysis. Results Four randomized trials totaling 5,356 patients met the inclusion criteria. In patients with LBBB at baseline, there was a highly significant reduction in composite adverse clinical events with CRT (RR = 0.64 [95\% CI (0.52-0.77)], P = .00001). However no such benefit was observed for patients with non-LBBB conduction abnormalities (RR = 0.97 [95\% CI (0.82-1.15)], P = .75). When examined separately, there was no benefit in patients with right-bundle branch block (RR = 0.91 [95\% CI (0.69-1.20)], P = .49) or non-specific intraventricular conduction delay (RR = 1.19 [95\% CI (0.87-1.63)], P = .28). There was no heterogeneity among the clinical trials with regards to the lack of benefit in non-LBBB patients (I2 = 0\%). When directly compared, the difference in effect of CRT between LBBB versus non-LBBB patients was highly statistically significant (P = .0001 by heterogeneity analysis). Conclusions While CRT was very effective in reducing clinical events in patients with LBBB, it did not reduce such events in patients with wide QRS due to other conduction abnormalities.},

Studies using surrogate measures and subgroup analysis of large trials suggest that only patients with severely prolonged QRS benefit from CRT.

Trials reporting clinical events according to different QRS ranges were identified. Five randomized trials fulfilling the inclusion criteria (total patients, n~=~5813) were included in the meta-analysis.In patients with severely prolonged QRS, there was a reduction in composite clinical events with CRT (risk ratio, 0.60; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.53-0.67) (P~\&lt;~.001). In contrast, there was no benefit of CRT in patients with moderately prolonged QRS (RR, 0.95; 95\% CI, 0.82-1.10) (P~=~.49), resulting in a significantly different impact of CRT in the 2 QRS groups (P~\&lt;~.001). There was a significant relationship between baseline QRS duration and risk ratio (P~\&lt;~.001) with benefit of CRT appearing at a QRS of approximately 150 milliseconds and above. The differential response of the 2 QRS groups was evident for all New York Heart Association classes.Cardiac resynchronization therapy was effective in reducing adverse clinical events in patients with heart failure and a baseline QRS interval of 150 milliseconds or greater, but CRT did not reduce events in patients with a QRS of less than 150 milliseconds. These findings have implications for the selection of patients for CRT.},

Thirty-nine patients with PAH and 18 age and sex-matched healthy controls were included. LV volume and left atrial volume (LAV) were delineated in short-axis cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) cine images. LV longitudinal function was assessed from atrio-ventricular plane displacement (AVPD) and global longitudinal strain (GLS) was assessed using feature tracking in three long-axis views. LV filling was assessed by LAV and by pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) using right heart catheterisation. Patients had a smaller LAV, LV volume and stroke volume as well as a lower LV-AVPD and LV-GLS than controls. PAWP was 6 [IQR 5\textendash\textendash 9] mmHg in patients. LV ejection fraction did not differ between groups. LV stroke volume correlated with LV-AVPD (r = 0.445, p = .001), LV-GLS (r~=~-~0.549, p\,{$<$}\,0.0001) and LAVmax (r = .585, p\,{$<$}\,0.0001). Furthermore, LV-AVPD (r = .598) and LV-GLS (r~=~-~0.675) correlated with LAVmax (p\,{$<$}\,0.0001 for both). Neither LV-AVPD, LV-GLS, LAVmax nor stroke volume correlated with PAWP. Impaired LV longitudinal function was associated with low stroke volume, low PAWP and a small LAV in PAH. Small stroke volumes and LAV, together with normal LA pressure, implies that the mechanism causing reduced LV longitudinal function is underfilling rather than an intrinsic LV dysfunction in PAH.},

  abstract = {The impact of left bundle branch block (LBBB) on cardiac mechanical function ranges from minimal effect in some patients to marked reduction in left ventricular (LV) systolic function in others. It appears that this variability in part reflects differences in anatomical location of the bundle block. In most patients with LBBB and congestive heart failure, however, there is associated cardiac disease such as cardiomyopathies or coronary artery disease which contributes to LV dysfunction. The mechanism of harmful effect of LBBB on cardiac function is in-coordinated ventricular contractions which result in LV contractile inefficiency. Septal contribution to LV systolic function is lost or attenuated and an excessive workload is placed on the LV free wall which responds with remodeling and in some cases it decompensates. The magnitude of the contractile inefficiency depends on the extent of electrical conduction delay and degree of associated heart disease. Another mechanism, which in many patients contributes to cardiac dysfunction in LBBB, is mitral regurgitation due to in-coordinated contractions of the papillary muscles and altered mitral valve function due to LV remodeling. Potentially, reduced LV filling time due to prolonged LV systole may contribute to cardiac dysfunction, but there is limited knowledge about the clinical importance of this mechanism. In LBBB there is typically reduced septal perfusion, probably not as a sign of ischemia, but reflecting physiologic autoregulation of coronary flow in response to reduced septal work that reduces metabolic demand. Future studies should explore how current insights into mechanisms of cardiac mechanical effects of LBBB can be incorporated into decision algorithms for selection of patients for cardiac resynchronization therapy, as well as how to manage patients with LBBB and preserved LV function.},

Optimistic estimation of the C statistic is a frequent problem because of overfitting of statistical models in small data sets, and methods exist to correct for this issue. However, many studies do not use such methods, and those that do correct for optimism use diverse methods, some of which are known to be biased. We used clinical data sets (United Kingdom Down syndrome screening data from Glasgow (1991-2003), Edinburgh (1999-2003), and Cambridge (1990-2006), as well as Scottish national pregnancy discharge data (2004-2007)) to evaluate different approaches to adjustment for optimism. We found that sample splitting, cross-validation without replication, and leave-1-out cross-validation produced optimism-adjusted estimates of the C statistic that were biased and/or associated with greater absolute error than other available methods. Cross-validation with replication, bootstrapping, and a new method (leave-pair-out cross-validation) all generated unbiased optimism-adjusted estimates of the C statistic and had similar absolute errors in the clinical data set. Larger simulation studies confirmed that all 3 methods performed similarly with 10 or more events per variable, or when the C statistic was 0.9 or greater. However, with lower events per variable or lower C statistics, bootstrapping tended to be optimistic but with lower absolute and mean squared errors than both methods of cross-validation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS OF STUDY: Septal flash (SF) describes early inward motion of the ventricular septum in patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB), and correction corresponds to increased response to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). SF has traditionally been assessed by echocardiography. We sought to determine if cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging could identify SF and if the additional assessment of scar would improve the ability of CMR to predict CRT response. METHODS: Fifty-two patients with LBBB and heart failure underwent prospective CMR scanning prior to CRT implantation. The presence of SF was assessed visually and by using endocardial contour-tracking software. Presence and extent of myocardial scar was assessed by delayed enhancement imaging during CMR. The association between SF, scar and reverse remodelling (RR) at 6 months was explored. RESULTS: RR rate to CRT at 6 months was 52\%. CMR-derived SF was identified in 24 (46\%) patients. RR was seen in more patients with SF than those without (88\% vs 21\%; P\,{$<$}\,0.001). The absence of scar combined with the presence of SF had 96\% specificity for predicting RR. In a multivariate regression model, the presence of SF was the only independent predictor of RR. CONCLUSION: SF can be assessed by CMR and predicts increased response to CRT. The additional value of CMR is the assessment of scar. The presence of SF with no scar is a highly specific predictor of CRT response.},

  abstract = {Objectives The objective of the SMINC-2 (Stockholm Myocardial Infarction With Normal Coronaries 2) study was to determine if more than 70\% of patients with myocardial infarction with nonobstructed coronary arteries (MINOCA), investigated early with comprehensive cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR), could receive a diagnosis entirely by imaging. Background The etiology of MINOCA is heterogeneous, including coronary, cardiac, and noncardiac causes. Patients with MINOCA, therefore, represent a diagnostic challenge where CMR is increasingly used. Methods The SMINC-2 study was a prospective study of 148 patients with MINOCA imaged with 1.5-T CMR with T1 and extracellular volume mapping early after hospital admission, compared to 150 patients with MINOCA imaged using 1.5-T CMR without mapping techniques from the SMINC-1 study as historic controls. Results CMR was performed at a median of 3 (SMINC-2) versus 12 (SMINC-1) days after hospital admission. In total, 77\% of patients received a diagnosis with CMR imaging in the SMINC-2 study compared to 47\% in the SMINC-1 study (p~{$<~$}0.001). Compared to SMINC-1, CMR in SMINC-2 detected higher proportions of myocarditis (17\% vs. 7\%; p~=~0.01) and takotsubo syndrome (35\% vs. 19\%; p~=~0.002) but similar proportions of myocardial infarction (22\% vs. 19\%; p~=~0.56) and other cardiomyopathies (3\% vs. 2\%; p~=~0.46). Conclusions The results of the SMINC-2 study show that 77\% of all patients with MINOCA received a diagnosis when imaged early with CMR, including advanced tissue characterization, which was a considerable improvement in comparison to the SMINC-1 study. This supports the use of early CMR imaging as a diagnostic tool in the investigation of patients with MINOCA.

However, until now, there has been no device capable of displaying, in real time on a beat-to-beat basis, changes in QTV in all 12 conventional leads in a continuously monitored patient. Although several software programs have been designed to analyze QTV, heretofore, such programs have all involved only a few channels (at most) and/or have required laborious user interaction or offline calculations and postprocessing, limiting their clinical utility. This article describes a PC-based electrocardiogram software program recently codeveloped by our laboratories that, in real time, acquires, analyzes, and displays QTV in each of the 8 independent channels that constitute the 12-lead conventional electrocardiogram. The system also analyzes and displays the QTV from QT-interval signals that are derived from multiple channels and from singular value decomposition such that the effect of noise and other artifacts on the QTV results are substantially reduced compared with existing single-channel methods.},

  abstract = {A hydraulic force generated by blood moving the atrioventricular plane is a novel mechanism of diastolic function. The direction and magnitude of the force is dependent on the geometrical relationship between the left atrium and ventricle and is measured as the short-axis atrioventricular area difference (AVAD). In short, the net hydraulic force acts from a larger area toward a smaller one. It is currently unknown how cardiac remodeling affects this mechanism. The aim of the study was therefore to investigate this diastolic mechanism in patients with pathological or physiological remodeling. Seventy subjects [n = 11 heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), n = 10 heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), n = 7 signs of isolated diastolic dysfunction, n = 10 hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, n = 10 cardiac amyloidosis, n = 18 triathletes, and n = 14 controls] were included. Subjects underwent cardiac MR, and short-axis images of the left atrium and ventricle were delineated. AVAD was calculated as ventricular area minus atrial area and used as an indicator of net hydraulic force. At the onset of diastole, AVAD in HFpEF was -9.2 cm2 (median) versus -4.4 cm2 in controls, P = 0.02. The net hydraulic force was directed toward the ventricle for both but was larger in HFpEF. HFrEF was the only group with a positive median value (11.6 cm2), and net hydraulic force was throughout diastole directed toward the atrium. The net hydraulic force may impede cardiac filling throughout diastole in HFpEF, worsening diastolic dysfunction. In contrast, it may work favorably in patients with dilated ventricles and aid ventricular filling.NEW \& NOTEWORTHY It is a previously unrecognized physiological mechanism of the heart that diastolic filling occurs with the help of hydraulics. In patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, atrial dilatation may cause the net hydraulic force to work against cardiac filling, thus further augmenting diastolic dysfunction. In contrast, it may work favorably in patients with dilated ventricles, as in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.},

  abstract = {Objectives This study sought to investigate the influence of scar extent and location on the motion pattern of the left ventricle (LV) and its interaction with LV conduction delays. Background Different echocardiographic parameters have been proposed to identify responders to cardiac resynchronization therapy based on the detection of LV mechanical dyssynchrony. However, the impact of infarct scar on the diagnostic performance of these parameters remains unknown. Methods We included 11 healthy volunteers and 122 patients with normal and severely reduced function, wide and narrow QRS, as well as with and without infarct scar. Location and extent of infarct scar was defined by contrast-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance. Influence of infarct scar on the motion pattern of the LV was examined by measuring direction and amplitude of apical rocking. The influence of scar on different echocardiographic dyssynchrony parameters was investigated. Results Scar in the absence of conduction delay caused most apical rocking in the presence of 3 to 4 infarct segments. Pure apical infarction caused no rocking. In wide QRS patients without infarct scar, apical rocking was mainly dominated by the conduction delay, whereas in wide QRS patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy, this pattern~was modulated by the~scar. Apical rocking was inversely related to scar extent (r~= -0.54, p~{$<$} 0.05). Apical rocking was better associated with cardiac resynchronization therapy response than conventional dyssynchrony measurements. Conclusions LV motion patterns are mainly dominated by conduction delays, but they are also modulated by infarct scar.~Higher scar burden resulted in less pronounced apical rocking. Apical rocking is more strongly associated with cardiac resynchronization therapy response than with conventional echocardiographic parameters and may therefore be used as a~screening parameter.},

Several internal validation methods are available that aim to provide a more accurate estimate of model performance in new subjects. We evaluated several variants of split-sample, cross-validation and bootstrapping methods with a logistic regression model that included eight predictors for 30-day mortality after an acute myocardial infarction. Random samples with a size between n = 572 and n = 9165 were drawn from a large data set (GUSTO-I; n = 40,830; 2851 deaths) to reflect modeling in data sets with between 5 and 80 events per variable. Independent performance was determined on the remaining subjects. Performance measures included discriminative ability, calibration and overall accuracy. We found that split-sample analyses gave overly pessimistic estimates of performance, with large variability. Cross-validation on 10\% of the sample had low bias and low variability, but was not suitable for all performance measures. Internal validity could best be estimated with bootstrapping, which provided stable estimates with low bias. We conclude that split-sample validation is inefficient, and recommend bootstrapping for estimation of internal validity of a predictive logistic regression model.},

  abstract = {Logistic regression analysis may well be used to develop a prognostic model for a dichotomous outcome. Especially when limited data are available, it is di\$cult to determine an appropriate selection of covariables for inclusion in such models. Also, predictions may be improved by applying some sort of shrinkage in the estimation of regression coe\$cients. In this study we compare the performance of several selection and shrinkage methods in small data sets of patients with acute myocardial infarction, where we aim to predict 30-day mortality. Selection methods included backward stepwise selection with signi"cance levels of 0.01, 0.05, 0.157 (the AIC criterion) or 0.50, and the use of qualitative external information on the sign of regression coe\$cients in the model. Estimation methods included standard maximum likelihood, the use of a linear shrinkage factor, penalized maximum likelihood, the Lasso, or quantitative external information on univariable regression coe\$cients. We found that stepwise selection with a low (for example, 0.05) led to a relatively poor model performance, when evaluated on independent data. Substantially better performance was obtained with full models with a limited number of important predictors, where regression coe\$cients were reduced with any of the shrinkage methods. Incorporation of external information for selection and estimation improved the stability and quality of the prognostic models. We therefore recommend shrinkage methods in full models including prespeci"ed predictors and incorporation of external information, when prognostic models are constructed in small data sets.

  abstract = {Objectives The purpose of this study was to investigate how LBBB and CRT modify RV free wall function by direct ventricular interaction. Background Right ventricular (RV) function influences prognosis in patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB) and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). There is, however, limited insight into how LBBB and CRT affect RV function. Methods In 24 patients with LBBB with nonischemic cardiomyopathy, RV and left ventricular (LV) strain by speckle-tracking echocardiography was measured before and after CRT. Underlying mechanisms were studied in 16 anesthetized dogs with ultrasonic dimension crystals and micromanometers. Results Patients with LBBB demonstrated distinct early systolic shortening in the RV free wall, which coincided with the typical abnormal early systolic septal shortening. In animals, this RV free wall contraction pattern resulted in reduced myocardial work as a large portion of the shortening occurred against low pressure during early systole, coinciding with abnormal leftward septal motion. RV systolic function was maintained by vigorous contraction in the late-activated LV lateral wall, which pushed the septum toward the RV. CRT reduced abnormal septal motion and increased RV free wall work because there was less inefficient shortening against low pressure. Conclusions LBBB reduces workload on the RV free wall because of abnormal septal motion and delayed activation of the LV lateral wall. Restoring septal and LV function by CRT increases workload in RV free wall and may explain why patients with RV failure respond poorly to CRT.

  abstract = {Background\textemdash{} Myocardial scarring from infarction or nonischemic fibrosis forms an arrhythmogenic substrate. The Selvester QRS score has been extensively validated for estimating myocardial infarction scar size in the absence of ECG confounders, but has not been tested to quantify scar in patients with hypertrophy, bundle branch/fascicular blocks, or nonischemic cardiomyopathy. We assessed the hypotheses that (1) QRS scores (modified for each ECG confounder) correctly identify and quantify scar in ischemic and nonischemic patients when compared with the reference standard of cardiac magnetic resonance using late-gadolinium enhancement, and (2) QRS-estimated scar size predicts inducible sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia during electrophysiological testing. Methods and Results\textemdash{} One hundred sixty-two patients with left ventricular ejection fraction {$\leq$}35\% (95 ischemic, 67 nonischemic) received 12-lead ECG and cardiac magnetic resonance using late-gadolinium enhancement before implantable cardioverter defibrillator placement for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death. QRS scores correctly diagnosed cardiovascular magnetic resonance scar presence with receiver operating characteristics area under the curve of 0.91 and correlation for scar quantification of r=0.74 (P{$<$}0.0001) for all patients. Performance within hypertrophy, conduction defect, and nonischemic subgroups ranged from area under the curve of 0.81 to 0.94 and r=0.60 to 0.80 (P{$<$}0.001 for all). Among the 137 patients undergoing electrophysiological or device testing, each 3-point QRS-score increase (9\% left ventricular scarring) was associated with an odds ratio for inducing monomorphic ventricular tachycardia of 2.2 (95\% CI, 1.5 to 3.2; P{$<$}0.001) for all patients, 1.7 (1.0 to 2.7, P=0.04) for ischemics, and 2.2 (1.0 to 5.0, P=0.05) for nonischemics. Conclusions\textemdash{} QRS scores identify and quantify scar in ischemic and nonischemic cardiomyopathy patients despite ECG confounders. Higher QRS-estimated scar size is associated with increased arrhythmogenesis and warrants further study as a risk-stratifying tool.},

  abstract = {Chronic total occlusion (CTO) is a critical and unique subgroup of coronary lesions. This study aimed to investigate the correlation between the Selvester QRS score and late gadolinium enhancement cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (LGE-CMRI) in quantifying myocardial scarring to provide a simple and feasible method for treating CTO. The medical records of 134 patients with absolute CTO who underwent coronary angiography between May 1, 2014 and December 30, 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. All patients were grouped according to the CTO location (RCA CTO, LAD CTO, LCX CTO, and multi-vessel CTO groups). The degree of myocardial scarring was determined according to the Selvester QRS score and using the LGE-CMRI. All patients were followed up for at least 12 months. Among the 62 CTO patients, 55 had occlusion of a single vessel and seven had occlusion of multiple vessels, of which 27 (43.55\%) were in the RCA CTO group, 16 (25.81\%) in the LAD CTO group, 12 (19.35\%) in the LCX CTO group, and 7 (11.29\%) in the multi-vessel CTO group. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the QRS score that was used to determine the degree of myocardial scarring was 0.806, with a sensitivity and specificity of 94.7\% and 42.1\%, respectively. The Selvester QRS score and LGE-CMRI measures of scar size were correlated in the RCA CTO, LCX CTO, and multi-vessel CTO groups (r = 0.466, 0.593, and 0.775, respectively). The Selvester QRS score was feasible for detecting myocardial scarring in patients with CTO. Whether the electrocardiography (ECG) serial changes predict outcomes in cardiac arrest survivors undergoing therapeutic hypothermia remains unclear. This retrospective observational study enrolled 366 adult nontraumatic cardiac arrest survivors who underwent therapeutic hypothermia in a tertiary transfer center during 2006\textendash 2018. The ECG at return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), during hypothermia and after rewarming were analyzed. 295 cardiac arrest survivors were included. Compared with the survivors, the non-survivors had longer QRS durations at the ROSC (118.33 {$\pm$} 32.47 ms vs 106.88 {$\pm$} 29.78 ms, p {$<$} 0.001) and after rewarming (99.26 {$\pm$} 25.07 ms vs 93.03 {$\pm$} 19.09 ms, p = 0.008). The enrolled patients were classified into 4 groups based on QRS duration at the ROSC and after rewarming, namely (1) narrow\textendash narrow (narrow QRS at ROSC and narrow QRS after rewarming, n = 156), (2) narrow\textendash wide (n = 29), (3) wide\textendash narrow (n = 87), and (4) wide\textendash wide (n = 23) group. The wide\textendash wide group had the worst survival rates [odds ratio (OR) = 0.141, p = 0.001], followed by the narrow\textendash wide group (OR 0.223, p = 0.003) and the wide\textendash narrow group (OR 0.389, p = 0.003). In cardiac arrest survivors given therapeutic hypothermia, QRS durations at the ROSC, after rewarming and their changes may predict survival to hospital discharge. Slow flow (SF) that develops after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is significantly associated with poor prognosis in Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (Non-STEMI) patients. Increased Selvester QRS score and Frontal QRS-T angle [f(QRS-T)] are related to adverse cardiovascular outcomes. We aimed to investigate the predictive role of the Selvester QRS score and f(QRS-T) for the development of post-PCI SF in patients with Non-STEMI. In a retrospective study, 210 patients with Non-STEMI were divided into two groups as SF (29) and Non-SF (181) according to their TIMI coronary flow grade. For all patients the Selvester QRS score and f(QRS-T) were calculated from automatic electrocardiography (ECG) reports. The mean age of the study population was 63 (55-75) years and 102 (68.6\%) of patients were male. The Selvester QRS score and f(QRS-T) were higher in the SF group than in the Non-SF group [(5[3\textendash 8], 3[2\textendash 5]); (67\textdegree{} [42\textdegree\textendash 88\textdegree ], 39\textdegree{} [24\textdegree\textendash 59\textdegree ]), respectively, all p {$<$}0.01]. In a logistic regression analysis, the Selvester QRS score (OR = 4,862; 95\% (CI) = 1,131-20,904, p =0.03) and f(QRS-T) (OR = 5,489; 95\% (CI)= 11,433-21,034, p =0.01) were found independent predictors of post-PCI SF in Non-STEMI patients. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to assess the diagnostic values of the Selvester QRS score [86\% sensitivity; 44\% specificity; cut off 2; (AUC, 0.693)] and f(QRS-T) [62\% sensitivity; 73\% specificity; cut off 58\textdegree; (AUC, 0.778)]. The Selvester QRS score and f(QRS-T), both easy-to-calculate ECG parameters, are predictors of post-PCI SF in Non-STEMI patients. Current LBBB definitions cannot always distinguish LBBB from left ventricular conduction delay. Only patients with LBBB are expected to normalize with His bundle pacing. Patients who develop new LBBB immediately post transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) provide an excellent model to define electrocardiogram (ECG) features of LBBB. We sought to describe their ECG features and develop a new ECG definition of LBBB. We screened ECGs from 264 consecutive patients who underwent TAVR at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute. Patients with a baseline QRS of {$\leq$}100 ms who developed QRS {$\geq$}120 ms immediately after TAVR were included. Two electrocardiologists reviewed all ECG independently. Baseline demographics and echocardiographic data were retrospectively collected. 36 patients were included in the analysis. The median age was 85.5 years (IQR, 81.8\textendash 89 years) and 52.8\% were males. The minimum QRS duration was 126 ms. The median QRS axis was -18\textdegree{} (IQR, -40\textendash 4.5\textdegree ), which is 18.5\textdegree{} leftward compared to the median QRS axis before TAVR. Fourteen patients (38.9\%) had left axis deviation. All patients had a notched/slurred R wave in at least one lateral lead and an R wave duration of {$\leq$}20 ms in V1 when present. We developed a new ECG definition of LBBB that includes 2 novel findings: notching/slurring of the R wave in at least one lateral lead and an R wave {$\leq$}20 ms in V1. Further larger studies are warranted to confirm these findings. Myocardial scarring from infarction or nonischemic fibrosis forms an arrhythmogenic substrate. The Selvester QRS score has been developed to estimate myocardial scar from the 12-lead electrocardiogram. We aimed to assess the value of an automated version of the Selvester QRS score for the prediction of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy and death in patients undergoing primary prevention ICD implantation. Unselected patients undergoing primary prevention ICD implantation were included in this retrospective, observational, multicenter study. The QRS score was calculated automatically from a digital standard preimplantation 12-lead electrocardiogram and was correlated to the occurrence of death and appropriate and inappropriate shocks during follow-up. Analyses were performed in groups defined by QRS duration {$<$} 130 ms vs {$\geq$} 130 ms. Overall, 1047 patients (872 [83\%] men; median age 64 years IQR [55-71]) with ischemic (648, 62\%) or nonischemic (399, 38\%) cardiomyopathy were included. The median QRS duration was 123 ms (interquartile range [IQR] 111\textendash 157 ms), and the median QRS score was 5 (IQR 2\textendash 8). The QRS duration was {$<$}130 ms in 59\% and {$\geq$}130 ms in 41\%. During a median follow-up of 45 months (IQR 24\textendash 72 months), a QRS score of {$\geq$}5 was independently associated with a significantly higher risk of mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.67; 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.05\textendash 2.66; P = .031) and appropriate (HR 1.83; 95\% CI 1.07\textendash 3.14; P = .028) and inappropriate (HR 2.32; 95\% CI 1.04\textendash 5.17; P = .039) shocks in patients with QRS duration {$\geq$} 130 ms. No association of the QRS score and outcome was observed in patients with QRS duration {$<$} 130 ms (P {$>$} .05). The automatically calculated Selvester QRS score, an indicator of myocardial scar burden, predicts mortality and appropriate and inappropriate shocks in patients undergoing primary prevention ICD implantation with a prolonged QRS duration.},

In BVS, if the statistical p value of a risk factor in bivariable analysis is greater than an arbitrary value (often p = 0.05), then this factor will not be allowed to compete for inclusion in multivariable analysis. This type of variable selection is inappropriate because the BVS method wrongly rejects potentially important variables when the relationship between an outcome and a risk factor is confounded by any confounder and when this confounder is not properly controlled. This article uses both hypothetical and actual data to show how a nonsignificant risk factor in bivariable analysis may actually be a significant risk factor in multivariable analysis if confounding is properly controlled. Furthermore, problems resulting from the automated forward and stepwise modeling with or without the presence of confounding are also addressed. To avoid these improper procedures and deficiencies, alternatives in performing multivariable analysis, including advantages and disadvantages of the BVS method and automated stepwise modeling, are reviewed and discussed.},

  abstract = {Background Recently we showed the predictive value of sum absolute QRST integral (SAI QRST) and repolarization lability for risk stratification of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in heart failure patients. The goal of this study was to compare SAI QRST and metrics of depolarization and repolarization variability in healthy men and women. Methods Orthogonal ECGs were recorded at rest for 10 minutes in 160 healthy men and women (mean age 39.6{$\pm$}14.6, 80 men). Mean spatial TT{${'}$} angle, and normalized variances of T loop area, of spatial T vector amplitude, of QT interval and Tpeak-Tend area were measured for assessment of repolarization lability. Normalized variances of spatial QRS vector and QRS loop area characterized variability of depolarization. In addition, variability indices (VI) were calculated to adjust for normalized heart rate variance. SAI QRST was measured as the averaged arithmetic sum of areas under the QRST curve. Results Men were characterized by shorter QTc (430.3{$\pm$}21.7 vs. 444.7{$\pm$}22.2 ms; P{$<$}0.0001) and larger SAI QRST (282.1{$\pm$}66.7 vs.204.9{$\pm$}58.5 mV*ms; P{$<$}0.0001). Repolarization lability negatively correlated with spatial T vector amplitude. Adjusted by normalized heart rate variance, QT variability index was significantly higher in women than in men (-1.54{$\pm$}0.38 vs. -1.70{$\pm$}0.33; P{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.017). However, in multivariate logistic regression after adjustment for body surface area, QTc, and spatial T vector amplitude, healthy men had 1.5\textendash 3 fold higher probability of having larger repolarization lability, as compared to healthy women (T vector amplitude variability index odds ratio 3.88(95\%CI 1.4\textendash 11.1; P{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.012).

Guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT), not CRT, is first-line therapy for patients with reduced LVEF with LBBB. However, there are little data on how patients with reduced LVEF and LBBB respond to GDMT. Objectives This study examined patients with cardiomyopathy and sought to assess rates of LVEF improvement for patients with LBBB compared to other QRS morphologies. Methods Using data from the Duke Echocardiography Laboratory Database, the study identified patients with baseline electrocardiography and LVEF~{$\leq$}35\% who had a follow-up LVEF 3 to 6~months later. The study excluded patients with severe valve disease, a cardiac device, left ventricular assist device, or heart transplant. QRS morphology was classified as LBBB, QRS duration~{$<$}120~ms (narrow QRS duration), or a wide QRS duration~{$\geq$}120~ms but not LBBB. Analysis of variance testing compared mean change in LVEF among the 3 groups with adjustment for significant comorbidities and GDMT. Results There were 659 patients that met the criteria: 111 LBBB (17\%), 59 wide QRS duration~{$\geq$}120~ms but not LBBB (9\%), and 489 narrow QRS duration (74\%). Adjusted mean increase in LVEF over 3 to 6~months in the 3 groups was 2.03\%, 5.28\%, and 8.00\%, respectively (p~{$<$} 0.0001). Results were similar when adjusted for interim revascularization and myocardial infarction. Comparison of mean LVEF improvement between patients with LBBB on GDMT and those not on GDMT showed virtually no difference (3.50\% vs. 3.44\%). The combined endpoint of heart failure hospitalization or mortality was highest for patients with LBBB. Conclusions LBBB is associated with a smaller degree of LVEF improvement compared with other QRS morphologies, even with GDMT. Some patients with LBBB may benefit from CRT earlier than guidelines currently recommend.},

  abstract = {Recent research suggests that left ventricular torsion is an important indicator of cardiac function. We used two theoretical models to study the mechanics of this phenomenon: a compressible cylinder and an incompressible ellipsoid of revolution. The analyses of both models account for large- strain passive and active material behavior, with a muscle fiber angle that varies linearly from endocardium to epicardium. Relative to the end- diastolic configuration, the predicted torsion exhibits several experimentally observed features, including a peak near end systole, rapid untwisting during isovolumic relaxation, and increased twist near the apex. The magnitude of the twist is sensitive to the fiber architecture, the ventricular geometry, and the compressibility and contractility of the myocardium. In particular, the model predicts that the systolic twist increases with increasing compressibility, contractility, and wall thickness, while it decreases with increasing cavity volume. The peak twist approximately doubles (from about 0.02 to 0.04 rad cm-1) with a doubling of myocardial compressibility or with a change in the endocardial/epicardial muscle fiber angles from 90-90\textdegree{} to 60-60\textdegree. The twist is less sensitive to changes in contractility and ventricular geometry. These findings provide a basis for interpreting measurements of ventricular torsion in the clinical setting.},

The purpose of this study was to investigate the benefits of CRT and significant variables on surface electrocardiogram (ECG) to predict response to CRT in those patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: Among the cohort of 152 CRT patients, 40 patients with IVCD were evaluated. Sixteen patients (40\%) were responders. At baseline, responders had a wider QRS duration (158+/-18 vs. 144+/-18ms, P=0.02) and a higher frequency of left axis deviation (LADEV; 75\% vs. 29\%, P=0.004) compared with non-responders. After CRT, greater shortening of QRS duration (DeltaQRS; 26+/-24 vs. 7+/-24ms, P=0.02), axis shift from LADEV to right axis deviation (RADEV; 69\% vs. 13\%, P{$<$}0.001), and both rightward forces in lead I and anterior forces in V1 (56\% vs. 13\%, P=0.003) were found more frequently in responders. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that LADEV at baseline, or DeltaQRS and axis shift from LADEV to RADEV after CRT were independent predictors of response to CRT. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IVCD may not respond to CRT, but LADEV at baseline and reversal of ventricular activation after CRT on surface ECG could be important to predict response to CRT.},

In this study, we sought to determine the efficacy of LA global longitudinal strain to estimate elevated LV filling pressure. Seventy-one consecutive patients (mean age of 63.2\,~{$\pm~$}\,9.75, 70\% male) who underwent left ventricular catheterization were included. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed within 24~h before catheterization. The LV filling pressure was estimated using echo parameters based on the 2016 ASE/EACVI algorithm. LA GLS was measured using 2D speckle tracking echocardiography in a four-chamber view (GE, Vivid E9 USA). Invasive LV pre-A pressure corresponding to the mean left atrial pressure (LAP) was used as a reference, and\,{$>$}\,12~mm Hg was defined as elevated. Invasive LV filling pressure was defined as elevated in 41 (58\%) and normal in 30 patients (42\%). The LV filling pressure of 9 (13\%) of 71 patients was defined as indeterminate based on the 2016 algorithm. Using the ROC method, 25.5\% of LA reservoir strain (LASr) had a higher sensitivity (AUC\,=\,0.79, specificity 77\%, sensitivity 80\%) in estimating LV filling pressure than the 2016 ASE/EACVI algorithm (AUC\,=\,0.75, specificity 77\%, sensitivity 70\%). LASr, with higher sensitivity than 2016 ASE/EACVI algorithm, may be used as a single parameter to estimate LV filling pressure and hence may add incremental value toHFpEF diagnosis.},

Baseline dyssynchrony was evaluated by four speckle tracking strain methods; radial, circumferential, transverse, and longitudinal ({$\geq$}130 ms opposing wall delay for each). Pre-specified outcome variables were EF response and three serious long-term events: death, transplant, or left ventricular assist device. Of 120 patients (91\%) with baseline dyssynchrony data, both short-axis radial strain and transverse strain from apical views were associated with favourable EF response 7 {$\pm$} 4 months and long-term outcome over 3.5 years (P \&lt; 0.01). Radial strain had the highest sensitivity at 86\% for predicting EF response with a specificity of 67\%. Serious long-term unfavourable events occurred in 20 patients after CRT, and happened three times more frequently in those who lacked baseline radial or transverse dyssynchrony than in patients with dyssynchrony (P \&lt; 0.01). Patients who lacked both radial and transverse dyssynchrony had unfavourable clinical events occur in 53\%, in contrast to events occurring in 12\% if baseline dyssynchrony was present (P \&lt; 0.01). Circumferential and longitudinal strains predicted response when dyssynchrony was detected, but failed to identify dyssynchrony in one-third of patients who responded to CRT.Dyssynchrony by speckle-tracking echocardiography using radial and transverse strains is associated with EF response and long-term outcome following CRT.},

  abstract = {In this work, we present a method to assess left ventricle (LV) regional function from cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging based on the regional ejection fraction (REF) and regional area strain (RAS). CMR scans were performed for 30 patients after first-time myocardial infarction (MI) and nine age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers. The CMR images were processed to reconstruct three-dimensional LV geometry, and the REF and RAS in a 16-segment model were computed using our proposed methodology. The method of computing the REF was tested and shown to be robust against variation in user input. Furthermore, analysis of data was feasible in all patients and healthy volunteers without any exclusions. The REF correlated well with the RAS in a nonlinear manner (quadratic fit\textemdash R2 = 0.88). In patients after first-time MI, the REF and RAS were significantly reduced across all 16 segments (REF: p {$<$} 0.05; RAS: p {$<$} 0.01). Moreover, the REF and RAS significantly decreased with the extent of transmural scar obtained from late gadolinium-enhanced CMR images. In addition, we show that the REF and RAS can be used to identify regions with compromised function in the patients with preserved global ejection fraction with reasonable accuracy (more than 78\%). These preliminary results confirmed the validity of our approach for accurate analysis of LV regional function. Our approach potentially offers physicians new insights into the local characteristics of the myocardial mechanics after a MI.},

The trial was interrupted prematurely by the Data Safety and Monitoring Board because of futility and safety concerns after 85 patients were randomized. Changes in exercise duration after 12 months were no different in patients with and without active cardiac resynchronization therapy (-0.7 minutes [95\% confidence interval (CI), -2.9 to 1.5] versus 0.8 minutes [95\% CI, -1.2 to 2.9]; P=0.31].

By restoring left ventricular (LV) electrical and mechanical synchrony, CRT can reduce mortality, improve LV function and reduce heart failure symptoms. Since its introduction, many advances have been made that have improved the delivery of and enhanced the response to CRT. Improving CRT outcomes begins with proper patient selection so CRT is delivered to all populations that could benefit from it, and limiting the implantation of CRT in those with a small chance of response. In addition, advancements in LV leads and delivery technologies coupled with multimodality imaging and electrical mapping have enabled operators to place coronary sinus leads in locations that will optimise electrical and mechanical synchrony. Finally, new pacing strategies using LV endocardial pacing or His bundle pacing have allowed for CRT delivery and improved response in patients with poor coronary sinus anatomy or lack of response to traditional CRT.},

  abstract = {Left bundle branch block (LBBB) is associated with improved outcome after cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT). One historical presumption of LBBB has been that the underlying pathophysiology involved diffuse disease throughout the distal conduction system. The ability to normalize wide QRS patterns with His bundle pacing (HBP) has called this notion into question. The determination of LBBB pattern is conventionally made by assessment of surface 12-lead ECGs and can include patients with and without conduction block, as assessed by invasive electrophysiology study (EPS). During a novel extension of the classical EPS to involve left-sided recordings, we found that conduction block associated with the LBBB pattern is most often proximal, usually within the left-sided His fibres, and these patients are the most likely to demonstrate QRS correction with HBP for resynchronisation. Patients with intact Purkinje activation and intraventricular conduction delay are less likely to benefit from HBP. Future EPS are required to determine the impact of newer approaches to conduction system pacing, including intraseptal or left ventricular septal pacing. Left-sided EPS has the potential to refine patient selection in CRT trials and may be used to physiologically phenotype distinct conduction patterns beyond LBBB pattern.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Septal activation in patients with left bundle-branch block (LBBB) patterns has not been described previously. We performed detailed intracardiac mapping of left septal conduction to assess for the presence and level of complete conduction block (CCB) in the His-Purkinje system. Response to His bundle pacing was assessed in patients with and without CCB in the left bundle. METHODS: Left septal mapping was performed with a linear multielectrode catheter in consecutive patients with LBBB pattern referred for device implantation (n=38) or substrate mapping (n=47). QRS width, His duration, His-ventricular (HV) intervals, and septal conduction patterns were analyzed. The site of CCB was localized to the level of the left-sided His fibers (left intrahisian) or left bundle branch. Patients with ventricular activation preceded by Purkinje potentials were categorized as having intact Purkinje activation. RESULTS: A total of 88 left septal conduction recordings were analyzed in 85 patients: 72 LBBB block pattern and 16 controls (narrow QRS, n=11; right bundle-branch block, n=5). Among patients with LBB block pattern, CCB within the proximal left conduction system was observed in 64\% (n=46) and intact Purkinje activation in the remaining 36\% (n=26). Intact Purkinje activation was observed in all controls. The site of block in patients with CCB was at the level of the left His bundle in 72\% and in the proximal left bundle branch in 28\%. His bundle pacing corrected wide QRS in 54\% of all patients with LBBB pattern and 85\% of those with CCB (94\% left intrahisian, 62\% proximal left bundle-branch). No patients with intact Purkinje activation demonstrated correction of QRS with His bundle pacing. CCB showed better predictive value (positive predictive value 85\%, negative predictive value 100\%, sensitivity 100\%) than surface ECG criteria for correction with His bundle pacing. CONCLUSIONS: Heterogeneous septal conduction was observed in patients with surface LBBB pattern, ranging from no discrete block to CCB. When block was present, we observed pathology localized within the left-sided His fibers (left intrahisian block), which was most amenable to corrective His bundle pacing by recruitment of latent Purkinje fibers. ECG criteria for LBBB incompletely predicted CCB, and intracardiac data might be useful in refining patient selection for resynchronization therapy.},

  abstract = {Predictors of Response to Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) (PROSPECT) was the first large-scale, multicentre clinical trial that evaluated the ability of several echocardiographic measures of mechanical dyssynchrony to predict response to CRT. Since response to CRT may be defined as a spectrum and likely influenced by many factors, this sub-analysis aimed to investigate the relationship between baseline characteristics and measures of response to CRT.A total of 286 patients were grouped according to relative reduction in left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESV) after 6 months of CRT: super-responders (reduction in LVESV {$\geq$}30\%), responders (reduction in LVESV 15\textendash 29\%), non-responders (reduction in LVESV 0\textendash 14\%), and negative responders (increase in LVESV). In addition, three subgroups were formed according to clinical and/or echocardiographic response: +/+ responders (clinical improvement and a reduction in LVESV {$\geq$}15\%), +/- responders (clinical improvement or a reduction in LVESV {$\geq$}15\%), and -/- responders (no clinical improvement and no reduction in LVESV {$\geq$}15\%). Differences in clinical and echocardiographic baseline characteristics between these subgroups were analysed. Super-responders were more frequently females, had non-ischaemic heart failure (HF), and had a wider QRS complex and more extensive mechanical dyssynchrony at baseline. Conversely, negative responders were more frequently in New York Heart Association class IV and had a history of ventricular tachycardia (VT). Combined positive responders after CRT (+/+ responders) had more non-ischaemic aetiology, more extensive mechanical dyssynchrony at baseline, and no history of VT.Sub-analysis of data from PROSPECT showed that gender, aetiology of HF, QRS duration, severity of HF, a history of VT, and the presence of baseline mechanical dyssynchrony influence clinical and/or LV reverse remodelling after CRT. Although integration of information about these characteristics would improve patient selection and counselling for CRT, further randomized controlled trials are necessary prior to changing the current guidelines regarding patient selection for CRT.},

  abstract = {Background: Cross-validation (CV) is an effective method for estimating the prediction error of a classifier. Some recent articles have proposed methods for optimizing classifiers by choosing classifier parameter values that minimize the CV error estimate. We have evaluated the validity of using the CV error estimate of the optimized classifier as an estimate of the true error expected on independent data. Results: We used CV to optimize the classification parameters for two kinds of classifiers; Shrunken Centroids and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Random training datasets were created, with no difference in the distribution of the features between the two classes. Using these "null" datasets, we selected classifier parameter values that minimized the CV error estimate. 10-fold CV was used for Shrunken Centroids while Leave-One-Out-CV (LOOCV) was used for the SVM. Independent test data was created to estimate the true error. With "null" and "non null" (with differential expression between the classes) data, we also tested a nested CV procedure, where an inner CV loop is used to perform the tuning of the parameters while an outer CV is used to compute an estimate of the error. The CV error estimate for the classifier with the optimal parameters was found to be a substantially biased estimate of the true error that the classifier would incur on independent data. Even though there is no real difference between the two classes for the "null" datasets, the CV error estimate for the Shrunken Centroid with the optimal parameters was less than 30\% on 18.5\% of simulated training data-sets. For SVM with optimal parameters the estimated error rate was less than 30\% on 38\% of "null" data-sets. Performance of the optimized classifiers on the independent test set was no better than chance. The nested CV procedure reduces the bias considerably and gives an estimate of the error that is very close to that obtained on the independent testing set for both Shrunken Centroids and SVM classifiers for "null" and "non-null" data distributions. Conclusion: We show that using CV to compute an error estimate for a classifier that has itself been tuned using CV gives a significantly biased estimate of the true error. Proper use of CV for estimating true error of a classifier developed using a well defined algorithm requires that all steps of the algorithm, including classifier parameter tuning, be repeated in each CV loop. A nested CV procedure provides an almost unbiased estimate of the true error.},

Objectives The authors sought to assess nonresponse in the prospective, international, ADVANCE CRT registry (Advance Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Registry). Methods Each subject's response was assessed at 6~months post-implantation using site-specific definitions and compared with the independently derived clinical composite score (CCS). Treatment(s) and hospitalization(s) were tracked during the following 6~months. Results Of 1,524 subjects enrolled in 69 centers (68 {$\pm$} 12 years of age, 32\% female, ischemic disease 39\%), 74.3\% received CRT-defibrillator devices, using mainly quadripolar LV leads (75\%) deployed laterally (78\%). Indications for CRT were wider than past trials. Among 1,327 evaluable subjects, site-defined nonresponse was 20.0\% (greater age, comorbidities, ischemic cardiomyopathy, non-left bundle branch block, and lower \%CRT pacing vs. responders). Site definitions used mainly clinical criteria (echocardiography infrequently), and underestimated nonresponders by 35\% compared with CCS (58\% sensitivity vs. CCS). Overall, more site-defined nonresponders received treatment (55.9\% vs. 38.3\% of responders; p~{$<~$}0.001) using medication changes and heart failure education, but device programming less frequently. Intensification of in-clinic/remote evaluations and involvement of heart failure specialists remained minimal. Remarkably, 44\% of site-defined nonresponders received no additional treatment. Frequency and duration of hospitalizations, and death, among site-defined nonresponders was significantly higher than responders. Conclusions A high incidence of CRT nonresponders persists despite good patient selection and LV lead position, but site identification methods have modest sensitivity. Following diagnosis, nonresponders are often passively managed, without specialty care, with poor outcome. ADVANCE CRT exposes a vulnerable group of heart failure patients.

Four patients had no organic heart disease (group I), six had cardiomyopathy (group LI), and eight had coronary artery disease and previous infarction (group III). Twelve patients had one septal site of left ventricular endocardial breakthrough, while six had two left ventricular endocardial breakthrough sites, with one site always being septal. There was no significant difference among the groups with respect to time of left ventricular breakthrough (group I, 44 msec after the onset of the QRS complex; group II, 58 msec; and group III, 51 msec). Total left ventricular endocardial activation time was significantly longer in group 111 (1 19 msec) than group 1 (81 msec; p {$<$} .05) and group 11 (61 msec; p {$<$} .001). Duration of total right ventricular endocardial activation was 36 msec (seven patients). The final site of right ventricular activation was at 44 msec after the onset of the QRS complex. We conclude that (1) right ventricular activation occurs before initiation of left ventricular activation in patients with LBBB, (2) left ventricular endocardial activation in patients with LBBB most likely occurs as a result of right-to-left transseptal activation, (3) left ventricular endocardial activation sequence in patients with LBBB is heterogenous, and (4) patients with coronary artery disease and LBBB have significantly longer total left ventricular endocardial activation times than patients with no organic heart disease or those with cardiomyopathies.},

Left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) pressures were recorded before and after induction of LBBB and during LBBB + LV apex pacing at different atrioventricular (AV) delays. Four IVA measures were validated using computer simulations on experimentally obtained pressure signals. The most robust measure for IVA was the time delay between the upslope of the LV and RV pressure signals ({$\Delta$}T up), estimated by cross correlation. The induction of experimental LBBB decreased {$\Delta$}T upfrom -6.9 {$\pm$} 7.0 ms (RV before LV) to -33.9 {$\pm$} 7.6 ms (P {$<$} 0.05) in combination with a significant decrease of LV maximal first derivative of pressure development over time (dP/dt max). During LV apex pacing, {$\Delta$}T up increased with decreasing AV delay up to +20.9 {$\pm$} 14.6 ms (P {$<$} 0.05). Interventricular resynchronization ({$\Delta$}T up = 0 ms) significantly improved LV dP/dt max by 15.1 {$\pm$} 5.9\%. QRS duration increased significantly after induction of LBBB but did not change during LV apex pacing. In conclusion, {$\Delta$}T up is a reliable measure of mechanical IVA, which adds valuable information concerning the nature of asynchronous activation of the ventricles.},

We investigated whether isolated LBBB causes these abnormalities.Methods and results In eight dogs, LBBB was induced by radio frequency ablation. Two-dimensional echocardiography showed that 16 weeks of LBBB decreased LV ejection fraction (by 23{$\pm$}14\%) and increased LV cavity volume (by 25{$\pm$}19\%) and wall mass (by 17{$\pm$}16\%). The LV septal-to-lateral wall mass ratio decreased by 6{$\pm$}9\%, indicating asymmetric hypertrophy. After onset of LBBB, myocardial blood flow (MBF, fluorescent microspheres) and systolic circumferential shortening [CSsys, magnetic resonance (MR) tagging] decreased in the septum to 83{$\pm$}16\% and -11{$\pm$}20\% of baseline, respectively, and increased in LV lateral wall to 118{$\pm$}12\% and 180{$\pm$}90\% of baseline, respectively. MBF and CSsys values did not change over 16 weeks of LBBB. Changes in external mechanical work paralleled those in CSsys. Glycogen content was not significantly different between septum and LV lateral wall of LBBB hearts (16 weeks) and control samples, indicating absence of hibernation.Conclusions The asynchronous ventricular activation during LBBB leads to redistribution of circumferential shortening and myocardial blood flow and, in the long run, LV remodelling. Septal hypoperfusion during LBBB appears to be primarily determined by reduced septal workload.},

However, currently available techniques lack full automation, limiting reproducibility. We propose a fully automated technique whereby a CMR image sequence is first segmented with a deep, fully convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, and quadratic basis splines are fitted simultaneously across all cardiac frames using least squares optimization. Experiments are performed using data from 42 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and 21 healthy control subjects. In terms of segmentation, we compared state-of-the-art CNN frameworks, U-Net and dilated convolution architectures, with and without temporal context, using cross validation with three folds. Performance relative to expert manual segmentation was similar across all networks: pixel accuracy was \textasciitilde 97\%, intersection-over-union (IoU) across all classes was \textasciitilde 87\%, and IoU across foreground classes only was \textasciitilde 85\%. Endocardial left ventricular circumferential strain calculated from the proposed pipeline was significantly different in control and disease subjects (-25.3\% vs -29.1\%, p = 0.006), in agreement with the current clinical literature.},

BACKGROUND CRT using biventricular pacing is effective in patients with heart failure and left bundle branch block (LBBB). LBBAP has been reported as an alternative option for CRT. METHODS LBBAP was attempted in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) {$<$}50\% and indications for CRT or pacing. Procedural outcomes, left bundle branch capture, New York Heart Association functional class, heart failure hospitalization, echocardiographic data, and lead complications were recorded. Clinical (no heart failure hospitalization and improvement in New York Heart Association functional class) and echocardiographic responses (\$5\% improvement in LVEF) were assessed. RESULTS LBBAP was attempted in 325 patients, and CRT was successfully achieved in 277 (85\%) (mean age 71 \AE{} 12 years, 35\% women, ischemic cardiomyopathy in 44\%). QRS configuration at baseline was LBBB in 39\% and non-LBBB in 46\%. Procedure and fluoroscopy duration were 105 \AE{} 54 and 19 \AE{} 15 min, respectively. LBBAP threshold and R-wave amplitudes were 0.6 \AE{} 0.3 V at 0.5 ms and 10.6 \AE{} 6 mV at implantation and remained stable during mean follow-up of 6 \AE{} 5 months. LBBAP resulted in significant QRS narrowing from 152 \AE{} 32 to 137 \AE{} 22 ms (p {$<$} 0.01). LVEF improved from 33 \AE{} 10\% to 44 \AE{} 11\% (p {$<$} 0.01). Clinical and echocardiographic responses were observed in 72\% and 73\% of patients, respectively. Baseline LBBB (odds ratio: 3.96; 95\% confidence interval: 1.64 to 9.26; p {$<$} 0.01) and left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (odds ratio: 0.62; 95\% confidence interval: 0.49 to 0.79; p {$<$} 0.01) were independent predictors of echocardiographic response. CONCLUSIONS LBBAP is feasible and safe and provides an alternative option for CRT. LBBAP provides remarkably low and stable pacing thresholds and was associated with improved clinical and echocardiographic outcomes.

Similar analyses were also performed for strain encoding, displacement encoding with stimulated echoes, and myocardial tagging. BACKGROUND: MRI-FT is a novel technique for quantification of myocardial deformation using MRI cine images. However, the reported 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) from the 2 largest studies have no overlaps. METHODS: Four databases (EMBASE, SCOPUS, PUBMED, and Web of Science) were systematically searched for MRI strains of the left (LV) and right (RV) ventricles. The key terms for MRI-FT were "tissue tracking," "feature tracking," "cardiac magnetic resonance," "cardiac MRI," "CMR," and "strain." A random effects model was used to pool LV global longitudinal strain (GLS), global circumferential strain (GCS), global radial strain (GRS), and RVGLS. Meta-regressions were used to identify the sources of variations. RESULTS: 659 healthy subjects were included from 18 papers for MRI-FT. Pooled mean of LVGLS was -20.1\% (95\% CI: -20.9 to -19.3), LVGCS -23\% (-24.3 to -21.7), LVGRS 34.1\% (28.5 to 39.7), and RVGLS -21.8\% (-23.3 to -20.2). Although there were no publication biases except for LVGCS, significant heterogeneities were found. Meta-regression showed that variation of LVGCS was associated with field strength (beta = 3.2; p = 0.041). Variations of LVGLS, LVGRS, and RVGLS were not associated with any of age, sex, software, field strength, sequence, LV ejection fraction, or LV size. LVGCS seems the most robust in MRI-FT. Among the MRI-derived strain techniques, the normal ranges were mostly concordant in LVGLS and LVGCS but varied substantially in LVGRS and RVGLS. CONCLUSIONS: The pooled means of 4 MRI-derived myocardial strain methods in normal subjects are demonstrated. Differences in field strength were attributed to variations of LVGCS.},

  abstract = {Background Late gadolinium enhancement and left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction on cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) are prognostic markers, but their predictive value for incident heart failure or life-threatening arrhythmias in acute myocarditis patients is limited. CMR-derived feature tracking provides a more sensitive analysis of myocardial function and may improve risk stratification in myocarditis. In this study, the prognostic value of LV, right ventricular, and left atrial strain in acute myocarditis patients is evaluated. Methods and Results In this multicenter retrospective study, patients with CMR-proven acute myocarditis were included. The primary end point was occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events: all-cause mortality, heart transplantation, heart failure hospitalizations, and life threatening arrhythmias. LV global longitudinal strain, global circumferential strain and global radial strain, right ventricular-global longitudinal strain and left atrial strain were measured. Unadjusted and adjusted cox proportional hazard regression analysis were performed. In total, 162 CMR-proven myocarditis patients were included (41~{$\pm$}\,17\,years, 75\% men). Mean LV ejection fraction was 51~{$\pm$}\,12\%, and 144 (89\%) patients had presence of late gadolinium enhancement. Major adverse cardiovascular events occurred in 29 (18\%) patients during a follow-up of 5.5 (2.2-8.3) years. All LV strain parameters were independent predictors of outcome beyond clinical features, LV ejection fraction and late gadolinium enhancement (LV-global longitudinal strain: hazard ratio [HR] 1.07, P=0.02; LV-global circumferential strain: HR 1.15, P=0.02; LV-global radial strain: HR 0.98, P=0.03), but right ventricular or left atrial strain did not predict outcome. Conclusions CMR-derived LV strain analysis provides independent prognostic value on top of clinical parameters, LV ejection fraction and late gadolinium enhancement in acute myocarditis patients, while left atrial and right ventricular strain seem to be of less importance.},

  abstract = {The concept of the ventricular gradient (VG) was conceived in the 1930s and its calculation yielded information that was not otherwise obtainable. The VG was not utilized by clinicians at large because it was not easy to understand and its computation time-consuming. Spatial vectorcardiography is based on the concept of the VG. Its current major clinical use is to identify primary [heterogeneity of ventricular action potential (VAP) morphology] in the presence of secondary [heterogeneity in ventricular depolarization instants] T-wave abnormalities in an ECG. Nowadays, the calculation of the spatial VG can be computed on the basis of a regular routine ECG and contributes to localization of arrhythmogenic areas in the heart by assessing overall and local VAP duration heterogeneity. Recent population-based studies suggest that the spatial VG is a dominant ECG predictor of future cardiovascular events and death and it is superior to more conventional ECG parameters. Its assessment warrants consideration for intensified primary and secondary prevention efforts and can be included in everyday clinical practice. This review addresses the nature and diagnostic potential of the spatial VG. The main focus is the role of the spatial VG in ECG assessment of dispersion of repolarization, a key factor in arrhythmogeneity.},

  abstract = {Abnormal left-right motion of the interventricular septum in early systole, known as septal flash (SF), is frequently observed in patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB). Transseptal pressure gradient and early active septal contraction have been proposed as explanations for SF. Similarities in timing (early systole) and location (septum) suggest that SF may be related to septal systolic rebound stretch (SRSsept). We aimed to clarify the mechanisms generating SF and SRSsept. The CircAdapt computer model was used to isolate the effects of timing of activation of the left ventricular free wall (LVFW), right ventricular free wall (RVFW), and septum on SF and SRSsept. LVFW and septal activation times were varied by {$\pm$}80 ms relative to RVFW activation time. M-mode-derived wall motions and septal strains were computed and used to quantify SF and SRSsept, respectively. SF depended on early activation of the RVFW relative to the LVFW. SF and SRSsept occurred in LBBB-like simulations and against a rising transseptal pressure gradient. When the septum was activated before both LVFW and RVFW, no SF occurred despite the presence of SRSsept. Computer simulations therefore indicate that SF and SRSsept have different underlying mechanisms, even though both can occur in LBBB. The mechanism of leftward motion during SF is early RVFW contraction pulling on and straightening the septum when unopposed by the LVFW. SRSsept is caused by late LVFW contraction following early contraction of the septum. Changes in transseptal pressure gradient are not the main cause of SF in LBBB.},

LV-MDWT was manually measured on automatically segmented short-axis images according to the American Heart Association's 17-segment model. Commercially available automatic software was used to calculate the left ventricular (LV) mass.ResultsAmong the 2383 patients, average LV-MDWT was 7.24 mm {$\pm$} 1.86 (standard deviation [SD]), with the basal anteroseptal segment being the thickest wall (8.71 mm {$\pm$} 2.19) and the apical inferior segment being the thinnest wall (5.9 mm {$\pm$} 1.58; P {$<$} .001). Over all LV segments, the maximum upper limit, as defined as 2 SD above the mean, was 13.6 mm for men (LV1) and 11.2 mm for women. For men, only the basal anterior segment was above 13 mm. There was a significant difference in average LV-MDWT between women and men with 6.47 mm {$\pm$} 1.07 and 7.90 mm {$\pm$} 1.24, respectively (P {$<$} .001). Significant differences in LV-MDWT were found in the subgroups aged less than 65 years and greater than or equal to 65 years (P {$<$} .001).

Purpose To assess the reproducibility of left ventricle (LV) segmental myocardial strain measured by deformation registration algorithm (DRA). Study Type Prospective clinical trial. Subjects Sixteen healthy volunteers and 28 hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients. Field Strength/Sequence Retrospective ECG gating cardiac MRI imaging was performed at 3.0T with a steady-state free precession (SSFP) sequence. Assessment LV global and segmental myocardial strains were analyzed by DRA, FT, and speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) by two experienced observers and the reproducibility of global and segmental strains were compared. Statistical Tests Reproducibility was tested by coefficient of variation (COV) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Receiver operator curves as well as comparison of areas under the curve (AUC) were analyzed. Results DRA showed the best observer agreement on segmental strain evaluated by ICC, LS (longitudinal strain): intraobserver variability range (0.98,1.00), interobserver variability range (0.83,0.92), CS (circumferential strain): intraobserver variability range (0.90,0.99), interobserver variability range (0.80,0.97), RS (radial strain): intraobserver variability range (0.84,0.99), interobserver variability range (0.85,0.99). Segmental LS, CS, and RS agreements evaluated by COV for FT and STE were poor. LV global myocardial strain of HCM was significantly lower than controls for all applied techniques, but global CS by DRA had better accuracy compared to FT or STE for distinguishing HCM from healthy subjects: AUC 0.880 (DRA) vs. 0.577 (FT) or 0.736 (STE), P {$<$} 0.05. Data Conclusions DRA is a reliable and robust analysis tool for segmental myocardial strain.

  abstract = {A left bundle-branch block (LBBB) contraction pattern identified from longitudinal-strain analysis predicts outcomes following cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). We investigated the use of an LBBB-contraction pattern identified from radial- or circumferential-strain analysis in the prediction of CRT benefits. Eighty CRT candidates were prospectively enrolled. Before CRT implantation, speckle-tracking analyses in three deformation directions were performed to determine whether an LBBB-contraction pattern was present. The study endpoints were reverse remodeling at 6 months, and adverse outcomes including death or heart failure hospitalization. At 6 months, 49 (61\%) patients had reverse remodeling. An LBBB-contraction pattern identified from the radial strain in the mid-ventricular short-axis view or longitudinal strain in the four-chamber view provided excellent true-positive (86\%) and false-negative (8\%) rates for predicting reverse remodeling. During a median follow-up of 30 months, 31 patients (39\%) had adverse outcomes. Absence of an LBBB-contraction pattern in radial (hazard ratio 3.74; 95\% confidence interval 1.83\textendash 7.62) or longitudinal strain (hazard ratio 3.49; 95\% confidence interval 1.71\textendash 7.13) was significantly associated with an increased risk of adverse outcomes. Adding the LBBB-pattern assessment by radial-(model {$\chi$}2 from 8.2 to 18.5, p = 0.005), or longitudinal-strain analysis (model {$\chi$}2 from 8.2 to 16.9, p = 0.011) to a risk model significantly improved the model, including QRS duration and ischemic etiology. In conclusion, an LBBB-contraction pattern identified from radial-strain analysis in the mid-ventricular short-axis view predicted reverse remodeling and outcome following CRT, similarly to the longitudinal-strain analysis.},

Whether enzyme replacement therapy is effective in all stages of Fabry cardiomyopathy during long-term follow-up is unknown. Methods and Results\textemdash{} We studied 32 Fabry patients over a period of 3 years regarding disease progression and clinical outcome under enzyme replacement therapy. Regional myocardial fibrosis was assessed by magnetic resonance imaging late-enhancement technique. Echocardiographic myocardial mass was calculated with the Devereux formula, and myocardial function was quantified by ultrasonic strain-rate imaging. In addition, exercise capacity was measured by bicycle stress test. All measurements were repeated at yearly intervals. At baseline, 9 patients demonstrated at least 2 fibrotic left ventricular segments (severe myocardial fibrosis), 11 had 1 left ventricular segment affected (mild fibrosis), and 12 were without fibrosis. In patients without fibrosis, enzyme replacement therapy resulted in a significant reduction in left ventricular mass (238{$\pm$}42 g at baseline, 202{$\pm$}46 g at 3 years; P for trend {$<$}0.001), an improvement in myocardial function (systolic radial strain rate, 2.3{$\pm$}0.4 and 2.9{$\pm$}0.6 seconds-1, respectively; P for trend=0.045), and a higher exercise capacity obtained by bicycle stress exercise (106{$\pm$}14 and 122{$\pm$}26 W, respectively; P for trend=0.014). In contrast, patients with mild or severe fibrosis showed a minor reduction in left ventricular hypertrophy and no improvement in myocardial function or exercise capacity.

  abstract = {1. The biases and shortcomings of stepwise multiple regression are well established within the statistical literature. However an examination of papers published in 2004 by three leading ecological and behavioural journals suggested that the use of this technique remains widespread: of 65 papers in which a multiple regression approach was used, 57 \% of studies used a stepwise procedure. 2. The principal drawbacks of stepwise multiple regression include bias in parameter estimation, inconsistencies among model selection algorithms, an inherent (but often overlooked) problem of multiple hypothesis testing, and an inappropriate focus or reliance on a single best model. We discuss each of these issue with examples. 3. We use a worked example of data on yellowhammer distribution collected over four years to highlight the pitfalls of stepwise regression. We show that stepwise regression allows models containing significant predictors to be obtained from each year's data. In spite of the significance of the selected models, they vary substantially between years and suggest patterns that are at odds with those determined by analysing the full, four year data set. 4. An Information Theoretic (IT) analysis of the yellowhammer data set illustrates why the varying outcomes of stepwise analyses arise. In particular, the IT approach identifies large numbers of competing models that could describe the data equally well, showing that no one model should be relied upon for inference. 2},

  abstract = {The genesis of cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT) consists of `bedside' research and `bench' studies that are performed in series with each other. In this field, the bench studies are crucial for understanding the pathophysiology of dyssynchrony and resynchronisation. In a way, CRT started with the insight that abnormal ventricular conduction, as caused by right ventricular pacing, has adverse effects. Out of this research came the ground-breaking insight that `simple' disturbances in impulse conduction, which were initially considered innocent, proved to result in a host of molecular and cellular derangements that lead to a vicious circle of remodelling processes that facilitate the development of heart failure. As a consequence, CRT does not only correct conduction abnormalities, but also improves myocardial properties at many levels. Interestingly, corrections by CRT do not exactly reverse the derangements, induced by dyssynchrony, but also activate novel pathways, a property that may open new avenues for the treatment of heart failure.},

Fortyfour semi-automatically measured ECG variables pre-selected based on the 2009 LBSS yielded one multivariable model for scar detection and another for scar quantification. Results: The 2009 LBSS achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.60 (95\% confidence interval 0.54\textendash 0.66) for scar detection, and R2 = 0.04, p b 0.001, for scar quantification. Multivariable modeling improved scar detection to AUC 0.72 (0.66\textendash 0.77) and scar quantification to R2 = 0.21, p b 0.001. Conclusions: The 2009 LBSS detects and quantifies myocardial scar with poor accuracy. Improved models with extensive comparison of ECG and CMR had modest performance, indicating limited room for improvement of the 2009 LBSS.},

As a result, data can get lost, analyses can take much longer than necessary, and researchers are limited in how effectively they can work with software and data. Computing workflows need to follow the same practices as lab projects and notebooks, with organized data, documented steps, and the project structured for reproducibility, but researchers new to computing often don't know where to start. This paper presents a set of good computing practices that every researcher can adopt, regardless of their current level of computational skill. These practices, which encompass data management, programming, collaborating with colleagues, organizing projects, tracking work, and writing manuscripts, are drawn from a wide variety of published sources from our daily lives and from our work with volunteer organizations that have delivered workshops to over 11,000 people since 2010.},

Background LBBB is associated with worse outcomes in patients with heart failure in the setting of severely reduced LVEF. The level of morbidity and mortality associated with LBBB in the setting of a mildly to moderately reduced LVEF (36\% to 50\%) has not been clearly characterized. This knowledge is important to clarify the potential benefit of cardiac resynchronization therapy in this group. Methods All patients identified as having an LBBB from 1994 to 2014 were included in the study if they had a baseline echocardiogram within 1 year and an LVEF between 36\% and 50\%. A control group without intraventricular conduction abnormality matched on age, sex, baseline LVEF, and date of echocardiogram was created. Outcomes were compared between the 2 groups. Results Of 1,436 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 54\% were male. Mean age was 67 {$\pm$} 13 years, and mean LVEF at baseline was 44 {$\pm$} 4\%. There was no difference in baseline heart failure diagnosis between groups. There were significantly higher rates of baseline coronary artery disease in the control group and higher rates of aortic stenosis in the LBBB group. LBBB was associated with significantly worse mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.17; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.00 to 1.36), an LVEF drop to 35\% or less (HR: 1.34; 95\% CI: 1.09 to 1.63), and the need for an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (HR: 1.50; 95\% CI: 1.10 to 2.10). Mortality remained significantly higher in the LBBB group when controlled for heart failure, coronary artery disease, and aortic stenosis (p~= 0.04). Conclusions Patients with a mildly to moderately reduced LVEF and LBBB have poor clinical outcomes that are~significantly worse than those for patients without conduction system disease. This group may obtain benefit from~cardiac resynchronization therapy and deserves to be studied in prospective trials.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Left ventricular segmental wall motion analysis is important for clinical decision making in cardiac diseases. Strain analysis with myocardial tissue tagging is the non-invasive gold standard for quantitative assessment, however, it is time-consuming. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance myocardial feature-tracking (CMR-FT) can rapidly perform strain analysis, because it can be employed with standard CMR cine-imaging. The aim is to validate segmental peak systolic circumferential strain (peak SCS) and time to peak systolic circumferential strain (T2P-SCS) analysed by CMR-FT against tissue tagging, and determine its intra and inter-observer variability. METHODS: Patients in whom both cine CMR and tissue tagging has been performed were selected. CMR-FT analysis was done using endocardial (CMR-FTendo) and mid-wall contours (CMR-FTmid). The Intra Class Correlation Coefficient (ICC) and Pearson correlation were calculated. RESULTS: 10 healthy volunteers, 10 left bundle branch block (LBBB) and 10 hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients were selected. With CMR-FT all 480 segments were analyzable and with tissue tagging 464 segments.Significant differences in mean peak SCS values of the total study group were present between CMR-FTendo and tissue tagging (-23.8 +/- 9.9\% vs -13.4 +/- 3.3\%, p{$<$}0.001). Differences were smaller between CMR-FTmid and tissue tagging (-16.4 +/- 6.1\% vs -13.4 +/- 3.3\%, p=0.001). The ICC of the mean peak SCS of the total study group between CMR-FTendo and tissue tagging was low (0.19 (95\%-CI-0.10-0.49), p=0.02). Comparable results were seen between CMR-FTmid and tissue tagging. In LBBB patients, mean T2P-SCS values measured with CMR-FTendo and CMR-FTmid were 418 +/- 66 ms, 454 +/- 60 ms, which were longer than with tissue tagging, 376 +/- 55 ms, both p{$<$}0.05. ICC of the mean T2P-SCS between CMR-FTendo and tissue tagging was 0.64 (95\%-CI-0.36-0.81), p{$<$}0.001, this was better in the healthy volunteers and LBBB group, whereas the ICC between CMR-FTmid and tissue tagging was lower.The intra and inter-observer agreement of segmental peak SCS with CMR-FTmid was lower compared with tissue tagging; similar results were seen for segmental T2P-SCS. CONCLUSIONS: The intra and inter-observer agreement of segmental peak SCS and T2P-SCS is substantially lower with CMR-FTmid compared with tissue tagging. Therefore, current segmental CMR-FTmid techniques are not yet applicable for clinical and research purposes.},

Also, controversies and problematic issues of the recent predictors of response to cardiac resynchronization therapy study were addressed.         Recent findings~         Despite published data from experienced centers that echocardiographic parameters of systolic dyssynchrony assessment with defined cutoff values were able to predict favorable response to CRT (septal-to-posterior wall delay by M-mode of 130 ms, tissue Doppler imaging of septal-to-lateral wall delay of 65 ms and Ts-SD of 33 ms, and speckle tracking delay in septal-to-posterior wall radial strain of 130 ms), the recent predictors of response to cardiac resynchronization therapy (PROSPECT) study did not concur with the observations. However, the latter study was flawed in multiple areas including site selection bias, dyssynchrony training, and selection of echocardiography equipment, echo core-laboratory experience and echocardiographic image quality surveillance. These factors acting in concert contributed to the high variability of dyssynchrony parameters, high echocardiographic data missing rate, and inconsistent measurement, which will not determine if dyssynchrony predicts a higher response rate than QRS duration alone.         Summary~         There is a learning curve for dyssynchrony assessment. Without proper dyssynchrony training and experience accumulation in a large number of implanting centers worldwide, a rush into multicenter trials that only focus on experienced device implantation will not be possible to replicate the role of dyssynchrony assessment.},

It also seems clear that the fundamental mechanism of CRT is correction of dyssynchrony, and we review the various methodologies available to detect dyssynchrony. Other factors are probably also important in determining outcomes such as lead position, the extent and form of myocardial damage, optimizing pacemaker performance, and clinical expertise. The potential costs of inappropriate CRT implantation are high to our patients and to the health economy, and it behoves the cardiology community to develop better selection criteria.

Design: Prospective study. Setting: University teaching hospital. Patients: 200 subjects were studied by echocardiography. 67 patients had HF and narrow QRS complexes ({$\leq$} 120 ms), 45 patients had HF and wide QRS complexes ({$>$} 120 ms), and 88 served as normal controls. Interventions: Echocardiography with tissue Doppler imaging was performed using a six basal, six mid-segmental model. Main outcome measures: Severity and prevalence of systolic and diastolic asynchrony, as assessed by the maximal difference in time to peak myocardial systolic contraction (TS) and early diastolic relaxation (TE), and the standard deviation of TS (TS-SD) and of TE (TE-SD) of the 12 LV segments. Results: The mean (SD) maximal difference in TS (controls 53 (23) ms v narrow QRS 107 (54) ms v wide QRS 130 (51) ms, both p {$<$} 0.001 v controls) and in TS-SD (controls 17.0 (7.8) ms v narrow QRS 33.8 (16.9) ms v wide QRS 42.0 (16.5) ms, both p {$<$} 0.001 v controls) was prolonged in the narrow QRS group compared with normal controls. Similarly, the maximal difference in TE (controls 59 (19) ms v narrow QRS 104 (71) ms v wide QRS 148 (87) ms, both p {$<$} 0.001 v controls) and in TE-SD (controls 18.5 (5.8) ms v narrow QRS 33.3 (27.7) ms v wide QRS 48.6 (30.2) ms, both p {$<$} 0.001 v controls) was prolonged in the narrow QRS group. The prevalence of systolic and diastolic asynchrony was 51\% and 46\%, respectively, in the narrow QRS group, and 73\% and 69\%, respectively, in the wide QRS group. Stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that a low mean myocardial systolic velocity from the six basal LV segments and a large LV end systolic diameter were independent predictors of systolic asynchrony, while a low mean myocardial early diastolic velocity and QRS complex duration were independent predictors of diastolic asynchrony. Conclusions: LV systolic and diastolic mechanical asynchrony is common in patients with HF with narrow QRS complexes. As QRS complex duration is not a determinant of systolic asynchrony, it implies that assessment of intraventricular synchronicity is probably more important than QRS duration in considering cardiac resynchronisation treatment.},

When the sample size is large, the observed effect size is a good estimator of the true effect size. One would hope that the post hoc power is also a good estimator of the true power. This article studies whether such a power estimator provides valuable information about the true power.Using analytical, numerical, and Monte Carlo approaches, our results show that the estimated power does not provide useful information when the true power is small. It is almost always a biased estimator of the true power. The bias can be negative or positive. Large sample size alone does not guarantee the post hoc power to be a good estimator of the true power. Actually, when the population variance is known, the cumulative distribution function of the post hoc power is solely a function of the population power. This distribution is uniform when the true power equals 0.5 and highly skewed when the true power is near 0 or 1. When the population variance is unknown, the post hoc power behaves essentially the same as when the variance is known.},

We sought to investigate the impact of mechanical dyssynchrony on diastolic function by comparing 4D flow in myopathic LVs with and without LBBB. CMR data were acquired at 3 T in 22 heart failure patients; 11 with LBBB and 11 without LBBB matched according to several demographic and clinical parameters. An established 4D flow analysis method was used to separate the LV end-diastolic (ED) volume into functional flow components based on the blood's timing and route through the heart cavities. While the Direct Flow volume was not different between the groups, the KE possessed at ED was lower in LBBB patients (P = 0.018). Direct Flow entering the LV during early diastolic filling possessed less KE at ED in LBBB patients compared to non-LBBB patients, whereas no intergroup difference was observed during late filling. Pre-systolic KE of LV Direct Flow was reduced in patients with LBBB compared to matched patients with normal conduction. These intriguing findings propose that 4D flow specific measures can serve as markers of LV mechanical dyssynchrony in heart failure patients, and could possibly be investigated as predictors of response to cardiac resynchronization therapy.},

Objectives This study evaluated the association of multiple comorbidities with the benefits of CRT over implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) alone. Methods We examined 1,214 MADIT-CRT (Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial with Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy) study patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB) and 0, 1, 2, or~{$\geq$}3 comorbidities, including renal dysfunction, hypertension (HTN), diabetes, coronary artery disease, history of atrial arrhythmias, history of ventricular arrhythmias, current smoking, and cerebrovascular accident. In an adjusted analysis, we analyzed risk of heart failure (HF) events or death by comorbidity group in all patients and in patients with CRT with defibrillator (CRT-D) versus ICD. Then we examined percent change in left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic volume, LV end-systolic volume, LV ejection fraction, left atrial volume, and LV dyssynchrony at 1-year in CRT-D patients by comorbidity group. Results There was an inverse relationship between comorbidity burden and improvements in LV end-systolic volume, LV end-diastolic volume, left ventricular ejection fraction, left atrial volume, and LV dyssynchrony. In an adjusted model,~there was an increasing risk of death or nonfatal HF events with increasing comorbidity burden regardless of treatment group (p~{$<$} 0.001). During a mean follow-up of 4.65 years, there was no interaction with respect to comorbidity burden and the benefit of CRT-D versus ICD only for death or nonfatal HF events (interaction p~= 0.943). In~the groups with greatest comorbidity burden (2 and~{$\geq$}3), the absolute risk reduction associated with CRT-D over ICD~alone appeared greater than that seen for groups with less comorbidity burden (0 and 1). Conclusions During long-term follow-up of MADIT-CRT study patients with LBBB randomized to CRT-D, there were~differences in HF or death risk and in the degree of reverse remodeling among comorbidity groups. However,~the~burden of comorbidity does not appear to compromise the clinical benefits of CRT-D compared with ICD alone.},

Cardiac resynchronization therapy with biventricular pacing reduces ventricular dyssynchrony and results in clinical benefits in subsets of patients with heart failure with QRS prolongation. Recently, His bundle pacing has increased in use as a physiological pacing modality but is limited by difficult implantation, lower success rates in patients with QRS prolongation, and high, often unstable, pacing capture threshold. Thus, the concept of pacing the conduction system distal to the His bundle to bypass the region of conduction block was proposed. Early clinical studies demonstrated the procedural feasibility of left bundle branch pacing using a transventricular septal approach that generates narrow paced QRS duration, fast synchronized left ventricular activation, and correction of left bundle branch block. The current status and future direction of left bundle branch pacing are summarized in this paper.},

Cox proportional-hazards regression was performed for mortality risk in Women with LBBB (n = 714) and those with RBBB (n = 832). In risk models adjusted for demographic and clinical risk factors in women with cardiovascular disease (CVD), hazard ratios for CHD death were 2.92 (95\% confidence interval 2.08 to 4.08, p {$<$}0.001) for LBBB and 1.62 (95\% confidence interval 1.08 to 2.43, p {$<$}0.05) for RBBB, and only LBBB was a significant predictor of all-cause death (hazard ratio 1.43, 95\% confidence interval 1.11 to 1.83, p {$<$}0.01). In CVD-free women, only LBBB was a significant predictor of CHD death (fully adjusted hazard ratio 2.17, 95\% confidence interval 1.37 to 3.43, p {$<$}0.01), and neither blocks was predictive of all-cause death. From several repolarization variables that were significant mortality predictors in univariate risk models, after adjustment for other electrocardiographic covariates and risk factors, ST J-point depression in lead aVL {$\leq-$}30 {$\mu$}V in women with LBBB was an independent predictor of CHD death, with a more than fivefold increase in risk. None of the repolarization variables were independent predictors in women with RBBB. In conclusion, prevalent LBBB in CVD-free women and LBBB and RBBB in women with CVD were significant predictors of CHD death. In women with LBBB, ST J-point depression in lead aVL was a strong independent predictor of CHD death.},

  abstract = {Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder associated with aging. Understanding how the disease progresses and identifying related pathological biomarkers for the progression is of primary importance in the clinical diagnosis and prognosis of Alzheimer's disease. In this paper, we develop novel multi-task learning techniques to predict the disease progression measured by cognitive scores and select biomarkers predictive of the progression. In multi-task learning, the prediction of cognitive scores at each time point is considered as a task, and multiple prediction tasks at different time points are performed simultaneously to capture the temporal smoothness of the prediction models across different time points. Specifically, we propose a novel convex fused sparse group Lasso (cFSGL) formulation that allows the simultaneous selection of a common set of biomarkers for multiple time points and specific sets of biomarkers for different time points using the sparse group Lasso penalty and in the meantime incorporates the temporal smoothness using the fused Lasso penalty. The proposed formulation is challenging to solve due to the use of several non-smooth penalties. One of the main technical contributions of this paper is to show that the proximal operator associated with the proposed formulation exhibits a certain decomposition property and can be computed efficiently; thus cFSGL can be solved efficiently using the accelerated gradient method. To further improve the model, we propose two non-convex formulations to reduce the shrinkage bias inherent in the convex formulation. We employ the difference of convex (DC) programming technique to solve the non-convex formulations. We have performed extensive experiments using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed progression models in comparison with existing methods for disease progression. We also perform longitudinal stability selection to identify and analyze the temporal patterns of biomarkers in disease progression.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We aimed to study the relation between onset and peak time of circumferential shortening and the direction of propagation of these parameters in both ischemic and nonischemic patients. BACKGROUND: Peak time is often used to select patients for cardiac resynchronization therapy, whereas pacing influences only the onset times directly. Furthermore, it is unclear whether there is a consistent direction of propagation delay and whether this depends on the etiology. METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging myocardial tagging with high temporal resolution (14 ms) was applied to 29 patients (18 nonischemic, 11 ischemic) and 17 healthy control subjects. Time to onset (T(onset)), to first peak (T(peak,first)), and to maximum peak (T(peak,max)) of circumferential shortening were determined. Three-dimensional vectors were calculated to denote the main direction of asynchrony. RESULTS: In both patient groups, T(onset) showed a significant positive relation with both T(peak,first) and T(peak,max); however, T(peak,first) correlated considerably better with T(onset) than did T(peak,max) (p {$<$} 0.0001 for nonischemic, and p {$<$} 0.01 for ischemic patients). Moreover, the relations between T(peak) and T(onset) were stronger in the nonischemic patients than in the ischemic patients (p {$<$} 0.001). In nonischemic patients, the propagation of T(onset) was consistently from septum to lateral wall. In the ischemic patients, however, no consistent direction of propagation was found. For both groups, the longitudinal propagation delays (between apex and base) were negligible compared with the short-axis delays. CONCLUSIONS: The relation between peak time and onset time of shortening is strongest in nonischemic patients and is most consistent when time to first peak is used (instead of time to maximum peak).},

In this work, timing of cardiac contraction was mapped in 17 healthy subjects with high-temporal-resolution (14 ms) MRI myocardial tagging and strain analysis. Both the onset time of circumferential shortening (Tonset) in early systole and the time of peak circumferential shortening (Tpeak) at end systole were determined. The onset of shortening width (time needed for 20\textendash 90\% of the left ventricle to start shortening) was small (35 {$\pm$} 9 ms). A distinct spatial pattern for Tonset was found, with earliest onset in the lateral wall and latest onset in the septum (P = 0.001). Compared with Tonset, Tpeak had a larger width (121 {$\pm$} 22 ms) and an opposite spatial pattern, with peak shortening occurring earlier in the septum than in the lateral wall (P {$<$} 0.001). Postsystolic shortening (Tpeak later than aortic valve closure; P {$<$} 0.05) was observed in 13 of the 30 cardiac segments, mainly in the lateral and basal segments. Shortening in these segments continued 58 {$\pm$} 14 ms after aortic valve closure, during which circumferential shortening increased from 16.9 {$\pm$} 1.2\% to 20.0 {$\pm$} 1.5\%.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB), QRS duration (QRSd) depends on left ventricular (LV) dimension. Previously, we demonstrated that normalizing QRSd to LV dimension, to adjust for variations in LV size, improved prediction of hemodynamic response to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). In addition, sex-specific differences in CRT outcome have been attributed to normalized QRSd. The present study evaluates the effect of normalization of QRSd to LV dimension on prediction of survival after CRT implantation. METHODS: In this 2-center study, we studied 250 heart failure patients with LV ejection fraction {$\leq$}35\% and QRSd {$\geq$}120 ms who underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging before CRT implantation. LV enddiastolic volumes were used for QRSd normalization (ie, QRSd/LV enddiastolic volumes). The primary end point was a combined end point of death, LV assist device, or heart transplantation. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 3.9 years, 79 (32\%) patients reached the primary end point. Using univariable Cox regression, unadjusted QRSd was unrelated to CRT outcome (P=0.116). In contrast, normalized QRSd was a strong predictor of survival (hazard ratio, 0.81 per 0.1 ms/mL; P=0.008). Women demonstrated higher normalized QRSd than men (0.62{$\pm$}0.17 versus 0.55{$\pm$}0.17 ms/mL; P=0.003) and showed better survival after CRT (hazard ratio, 0.52; P=0.018). A multivariable prognostic model included normalized QRSd together with age, atrial fibrillation, renal function, and heart failure cause, whereas sex, diabetes mellitus, strict left bundle branch block morphology, and LV end-diastolic volumes were expelled from the model. CONCLUSIONS: Normalization of QRSd to LV dimension improves prediction of survival after CRT implantation. In addition, sex-specific differences in CRT outcome might be attributed to the higher QRSd/LV end-diastolic volumes ratio that was found in selected women, indicating more conduction delay.},

  abstract = {ObjectivesAlthough myocardial strain analysis is a potential tool to improve patient selection for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), there is currently no validated clinical approach to derive segmental strains. We evaluated the novel segment length in cine (SLICE) technique to derive segmental strains from standard cardiovascular MR (CMR) cine images in CRT candidates.MethodsTwenty-seven patients with left bundle branch block underwent CMR examination including cine imaging and myocardial tagging (CMR-TAG). SLICE was performed by measuring segment length between anatomical landmarks throughout all phases on short-axis cines. This measure of frame-to-frame segment length change was compared to CMR-TAG circumferential strain measurements. Subsequently, conventional markers of CRT response were calculated.ResultsSegmental strains showed good to excellent agreement between SLICE and CMR-TAG (septum strain, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) 0.76; lateral wall strain, ICC 0.66). Conventional markers of CRT response also showed close agreement between both methods (ICC 0.61\textendash 0.78). Reproducibility of SLICE was excellent for intra-observer testing (all ICC {$\geq$}0.76) and good for interobserver testing (all ICC {$\geq$}0.61).ConclusionsThe novel SLICE post-processing technique on standard CMR cine images offers both accurate and robust segmental strain measures compared to the `gold standard' CMR-TAG technique, and has the advantage of being widely available. Key Points \textbullet{} Myocardial strain analysis could potentially improve patient selection for CRT. \textbullet{} Currently a well validated clinical approach to derive segmental strains is lacking. \textbullet{} The novel SLICE technique derives segmental strains from standard CMR cine images. \textbullet{} SLICE-derived strain markers of CRT response showed close agreement with CMR-TAG. \textbullet{} Future studies will focus on the prognostic value of SLICE in CRT candidates.},

  abstract = {Aims Various strain parameters and multiple imaging techniques are presently available including cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) tagging (CMR-TAG), CMR feature tracking (CMR-FT), and speckle tracking echocardiography (STE). This study aims to compare predictive performance of different strain parameters and evaluate results per imaging technique to predict cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) response. Methods and results Twenty-seven patients were prospectively enrolled and underwent CMR and echocardiographic examination before CRT implantation. Strain analysis was performed in circumferential (CMR-TAG, CMR-FT, and STE-circ) and longitudinal (STE-long) orientations. Regional strain values, parameters of dyssynchrony, and discoordination were calculated. After 12 months, CRT response was measured by the echocardiographic change in left ventricular (LV) end-systolic volume (LVESV). Twenty-six patients completed follow-up; mean LVESV change was -29 {$\pm$} 27\% with 17 (65\%) patients showing {$\geq$}15\% LVESV reduction. Measures of dyssynchrony (SD-TTPLV) and discoordination (ISFLV) were strongly related to CRT response when using CMR-TAG (R2 0.61 and R2 0.57, respectively), but showed poor correlations for CMR-FT and STE (all R2 {$\leq$} 0.32). In contrast, the end-systolic septal strain (ESSsep) parameter showed a consistent high correlation with LVESV change for all techniques (CMR-TAG R2 0.60; CMR-FT R2 0.50; STE-circ R2 0.43; and STE-long R2 0.43). After adjustment for QRS duration and QRS morphology, ESSsep remained an independent predictor of response per technique. Conclusions End-systolic septal strain was the only parameter with a consistent good relation to reverse remodelling after CRT, irrespective of assessment technique. In clinical practice, this measure can be obtained by any available strain imaging technique and provides predictive value on top of current guideline criteria.},
